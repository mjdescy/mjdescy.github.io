I bought my iPad Air 2 almost a year after it was released, only a few months before the first iPad Pro was released. I was a little worried at the time that I would get only a couple years out of it before iOS updates rendered it obsolete. I have been pleasantly surprised that that day has not yet arrivedâ€”and, based on how the iOS 12 beta is running, that day will not arrive for at least another year.

Last night, I finally installed the iOS 12 beta on it, and found the new OS to be smooth, stable, and fast. All my apps (even the ones I wrote!) are working just fine. As Apple promised, UI and animation-related things like scrolling are visibly faster and smoother, too. 

I plan to install iOS 12 beta on my iPhone 7 Plus in early September, after I complete my next release of [SwiftoDo](https://swiftodoapp.com). Based what I'm seeing, performance wise, on my even-older iPad Air 2, I'm looking forward to at least one more year of service from my iPhone 7 Plus, too. (It helps that my phone has a brand new battery and a new screen, thanks to AppleCare Plus.)
