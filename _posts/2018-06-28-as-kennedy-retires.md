No kidding, [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/as-kennedy-retires-the-supreme-courts-attack-on-labor-unions-is-a-sign-of-things-to-come), no kidding:

> For years, conservatives complained about activist liberal judges making it up as they went along. Today, they are the activists. Under the guise of “originalism,” they are rewriting the nation’s laws to further the reactionary political agenda of the Republican Party and its biggest donors.

Note the scare quotes around "originalism". It, like all the other -ism words we throw around—conservatism, liberalism, socialism—
is completely devoid of meaning.
