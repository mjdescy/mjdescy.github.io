According to my Account page, this is my 300th post on Micro.blog. I thought I would share some stats:

- Micro.blog posts: 300
- Days on the platform: 136 (joined 2017-12-19)
- Average posts per day: 2.2
- How many people I follow: 131
- How many people follow me: I have no idea, and that is fine
- How much engagement I get from other users: a pleasingly good amount
- How much I happily paid Manton for Micro.blog hosting thus far: $30 USD ($5/month, not including the free trial period)
- How little I could have paid, if I wanted: $0 for a WordPress.com blog or $1/month for an inexpensive WordPress host, plus the free Micro.blog account

Micro.blog has gotten me into blogging again after a long time away from it. I enjoy owning my own content, the focus on _writing_ rather than liking or retweeting, and, most of all, the lack of _friction_ in the platform.  Posting short or long form content is as simple as can be, and I don't have a WordPress install and/or server to maintain.

I am having fun on the platform and look forward to continuing to do so.
