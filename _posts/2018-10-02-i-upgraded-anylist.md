I upgraded AnyList, the iOS grocery list app I use, to the Pro version once again, so I could use the Apple Watch app. It worked reallly well—far better than it did a year ago. The watch app saved me from unpocketing and re-pocketing my phone about 39 times this evening. I’m pretty happy about that.
