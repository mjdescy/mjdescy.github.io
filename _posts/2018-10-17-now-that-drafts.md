Now that Drafts has a preview for the Mac, I wonder if it is time for me to try to migrate from Ulysses to Drafts for all my writing. I love both apps, and even use Ulysses to store all my writing now, but don't really want to pay for both subscriptions every year. I probably write more in Drafts than Ulysses day-to-day, anyway.
