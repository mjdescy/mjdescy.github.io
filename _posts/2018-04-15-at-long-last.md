📚 At long last, I have finished reading _[Team of Rivals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_of_Rivals)_ by Doris Kearns Goodwin. It (the last chapter and epilogue especially) has overwhelmed me with a sense of love and sadness, which is why it took me so long to read their whole thing. The book is a monumental achievement.
