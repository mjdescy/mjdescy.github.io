[The Last of the Tiger Parents](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/opinion/sunday/asian-american-tiger-parents.html) is a lovely article that provides a different, more introspective dimension to this weekâ€™s uproar about racial bias at [elite schools in New York City](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/nyregion/new-york-today-elite-high-schools.html) and [Harvard](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html).
