📽️ I saw "[Justice League](http://www.justiceleaguethemovie.com)" last night and really enjoyed it. I had very low expectations, due to its grim, overly macho [preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-DM9uBtVI) and [predecessor](http://batmanvsuperman.dccomics.com). I'm a comic book fan, though, and "Justice League” felt like the sort of story i've seen many times before, but, of course, filmed in live action with tons of special effects. I thought that the film _did_ have problems, but it was obviously made for comic book fans—who have read and seen the save-the-world story many times before, and want to see an even bigger version of it—and it succeeded more than all the negative reviews suggested. Yes, I could quibble about a dozen things, and I think the movie would have been even better with just Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman in it, but I enjoyed it quite a bit, and hope they make a sequel in a couple years.
