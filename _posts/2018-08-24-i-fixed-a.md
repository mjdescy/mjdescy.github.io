I fixed the SwiftoDo chrasher that I griped about this afternoon, and, to future-me's chagrin, I stayed up late to do it.

Tracking down the problem was tricky, but I eventually discovered that `UIDocument`'s `revert` method was failing because sometimes it was being executed on a closed file. It turns out that I was not interrogating `UIDocument.documentState` correctly when checking for "closed" file state. The `documentState` property is an OptionSet, and has a `contains` method that is more appropriate to use than `==` for this purpose.

At least, that what I think right now. I'll test my app out for a day or two and see if the nasty crash bug rears its head again, or moves to a new call site.
