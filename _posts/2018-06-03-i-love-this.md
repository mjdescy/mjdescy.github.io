I love [this article about iOS app architecture](http://aplus.rs/2017/much-ado-about-ios-app-architecture/):  

> Cocoa Touch is (I suspect) deliberately very simple: there’s Target-Action pattern, Dependency Injection, Delegate and MVC. That’s about it, really. Apparently it’s way too simple for some.

I am working on one or two practice projects right now, and can't think of a better way to code them than MVC with Coordinators.
