I just finished setting up my daughter's new Chromebook. I bought her an Asus C302C. It's a nice machine—66% of a MacBook Air for 50% of the cost, plus a touchscreen and 180º hinge for tablet mode.

I was happy to find out that setup was a snap, which I should have expected. Luckily for me, Chrome OS still resembles the windowed version I left behind years ago, so it is familiar enough for me to deal with when I need to.

I did have to figure out how to enable the hilariously named “Australian scrolling" feature on the touchpad, though. I guess the name "natural scroll direction” was taken. As a Mac user, I was surprised that it was not the default. I can't even remember what my Windows machines default to, though. Maybe natural scrolling is mainly an Apple thing.
