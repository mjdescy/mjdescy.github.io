I have been enjoying the [Roughly app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roughly-the-approximate-time-in-words/id1086283722?mt=8)'s complication (on the bottom, in the picture) for the Apple Watch. It's a little frivolous to display the approximate time in words, but it's also a little frivolous to use analog watch faces on a digital device.
