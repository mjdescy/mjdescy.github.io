My late-evening de-stressing video game sessions have moved from [Transistor](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/), which I played through twice, to [Oceanhorn](https://itunes.apple.com/is/app/oceanhorn/id708196645?mt=8). Oceanhorn plays like a Zelda clone. I'm finding it to be fun, and it has MFi controller support, which makes it much easier for me to play.
