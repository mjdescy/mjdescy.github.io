I started listening to podcasts in 2008. I think, now, I am, for the first time, burnt out on the medium. I listen to a lot of podcasts while I work, but lately I've found I can barely remember what the episodes were about shortly after they finish. I think I am tuning them out. 

I am paring back my subscriptions down—way down—to a few favorites and listening to more music instead. It's symmetrical to how I got into podcast listening: I was burnt out on listening to music all day long, and became uninterested in music for several years.
