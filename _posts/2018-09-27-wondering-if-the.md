I'm debating whether I should pay for [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com) Pro again, just to use the Apple Watch app. I paid for a year a while back, and the Apple Watch app did not work very well. It kept crashing or getting killed, and would not stay in sync with my iPhone. None of the other paid features are interesting to me. I like the rest of the app's features, though, and I'm getting the new Apple Watch in about a month, so maybe it will work this time. 🤷🏼‍♂️
