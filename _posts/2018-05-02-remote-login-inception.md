At work, our clients are far more interested in information security than they used to be. That's great, and I applaud them for it. Of course, as a user of their systems, there is a trade-off in terms of convenience. 

Lately, logging into remote systems seems like entering a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dreamâ€”a la _[Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/)_. Instead of merely using Remote Desktop to log into systems with a single username/password, we now follow in-depth login procedures using virtualization software, RSA tokens that generate unique, one-time passwords, Remote Desktop logins, and systems logins.
