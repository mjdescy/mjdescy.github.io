I wonder what it would be like if all the multi-exposure/HDR/Machine Learning technologies in the iPhone XS or Google Pixel were applied to a full frame camera with interchangeable lenses. Would that be the ultimate camera, in terms of picture quality? Would the technology not even work in that kind of camera for some reason? Would it work but not be necessary anymore? Are DSLRs more advanced than I even know, and do some of this stuff just as good as the latest iPhone or Pixel already?
