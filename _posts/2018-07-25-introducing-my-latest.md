[Simple Call Blocker](https://simplecallblockerapp.com) is a [free app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&mt=8) for blocking unwanted calls on iOS. 

It provides a basic way to block lots of numbers via a CallKit directory extension--which is great for blocking neighbor spam.

Unlike almost every other call blocker out there, mine is completely free and doesn't need access to your contacts to work. 

[Try it out.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&mt=8) It's free.

If you want to know more, there's a [website with screenshots and a FAQ](https://simplecallblockerapp.com). I wrote a [blog post](https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/introducing-simple-call-blocker/) describing my motivation for writing it, too.
