I am too busy coding tonight to order a [HomePod](https://www.apple.com/homepod/). The audiophile part of me really wants one, though. I have a fancy [BeoPlay M3](https://www.beoplay.com/landingpages/beoplaym3#introducing) speaker already, but I think the HomePod has cooler tech and is _just_ large enough to sound a whole lot better.
