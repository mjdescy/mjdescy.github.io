[Mean Girls (Original Broadway Cast)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mean-girls-original-broadway-cast-recording/1372106911) is up for the Tony for best musical this year, and I think it has a legitimate shot. While this _is_ a weak year for the American musical, the music of "Mean Girls" is fun and catchy, and the lyrics are funny and full of wordplay. The singing and production of the cast album are top notch, too.

I like it. The high school setting and girl-centric plot, though not the music, remind me a lot of "Bring It On", which is another musical that has a fantastic cast album and works a lot better than you would think. I don't know if this show will be a hit on Broadway, but I predict a long life on high school drama club stages in the future.
