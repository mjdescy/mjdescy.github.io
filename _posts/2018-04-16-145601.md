This [BeoPlay M3](https://www.beoplay.com/en/landingpages/beoplaym3#introducing) speaker is a better fit in my kitchen than two feet away from me at my office desk. We got a lot of use out of it yesterday, Airplaying from iPhones and our Apple TV. It sounds better when played more loudly, in a larger room.
