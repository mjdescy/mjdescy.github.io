Adding my [Nest thermostat](https://nest.com/thermostats/) to [HomeKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/home/) via [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has made my life a little better. I do have a suggestion for Apple, though: "Hey Siri, set thermostat to 70ยบ F and let no one in my family change it, _ever_, for any reason." Maybe I don't need a smart thermostat after all.
