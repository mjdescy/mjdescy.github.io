[Apple is adding more than 70 emoji in iOS 12.1](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/apple-brings-more-than-70-new-emoji-to-iphone-with-ios-12-1/).

While I don't see that as a bad thing, I find emoji to be a lot more frustrating now that there are so many. Emoji has the same problem as other pictographic languages: there are far too many glyphs to know what you can express, and there are far too few glyphs to express everything you might want to say.

Apparently, [I'm not the only one who thinks this way](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-emoji-overload-2018-10).
