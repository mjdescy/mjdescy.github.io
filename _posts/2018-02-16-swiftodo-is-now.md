[SwiftoDo 2.8.0 is now available in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftodo-task-list-for-todo.txt/id1073798440?ls=1&mt=8). It adds a picker to make adding recurrence pattern tags (for daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) to tasks easier. It also lets you drop tasks onto the task list from other apps (iPad only).
