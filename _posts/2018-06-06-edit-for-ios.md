[Edit for iOS](https://audaciousfox.net/projects/edit) is the second ultra-simple text editor for iOS—that I have noticed—that has been released this year. I was working on something like this last summer, but for TaskPaper, but abandoned it due to running into some snags, and needing to tend to SwiftoDo again. I think that the iOS share extension, and the increasing complexity of Drafts, has opened a little niche for iOS scratchpad text editors once again. Maybe I will dust of my little project sometime.
