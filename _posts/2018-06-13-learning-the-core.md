Lately I have taken it upon myself to finally teach myself [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html?utm_source=iosstash.io). I had avoided it for years, due to its complexity and because it was _too much_ for my projects. I decided to learn it to challenge myself and to level up a bit as an iOS developer.

Learning it reminds me of learning Objective C and Cocoa years ago. Core Data presents itself as a daunting hierarchy of NS-prefixed classes, with lots of layers and moving parts, but it (kind of) makes sense after a long period of study. It's starting to make sense to me now, though I have barely scratched the surface of its functionality.

I've been writing and rewriting and never finishing the same sample app for the past week. Of course, I made it difficult for myself by requiring it to have an App Group, and for the Core Data stack to be defined in its own Framework. I figured out how to do so a couple days ago, and then, this morning, stumbled on the exact same process recommended in [Apple's WWDC 2018 Core Data Best Practices video ](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/224). At least I know I got part of my Core Data stack set up the right way!
