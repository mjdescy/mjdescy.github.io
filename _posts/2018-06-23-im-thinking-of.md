I'm thinking of trading in my V-Moda Crossfade 2's plus $100 to upgrade to thier [Codex edition](https://v-moda.com/products/crossfade2-wireless-codex), which are the same headphones plus AAC and aptX support over Bluetooth. The better codecs will make them useful longer, like when the Lightning port goes away.
