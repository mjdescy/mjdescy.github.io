🎵 I'm trying to listen to the [Original Broadway Cast recording of "Pretty Woman: the Musical"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/pretty-woman-the-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1423345741) and it is hard to get through. So boring, so trite. The cast is good, though. Andy Karl, in particular, needs to find a role in a show not based on a movie for a change.
