I am upgrading my MacBook Pro to Mojave today. This is the latest into September I have waited to jump on the beta train since I started developing a Mac app several years ago. I do wish macOS upgrades were as quick and foolproof as iOS upgrades are. Last yearâ€™s upgrade nearly killed my old machine. I hope this one will work out.
