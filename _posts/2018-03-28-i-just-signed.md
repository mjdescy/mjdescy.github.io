I just signed up for the [Git Tower Version 2 Public Beta](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/tower-public-beta-2018-starts/). I'm not sure if I want to pay so much for a Git client (after the beta expires), when [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) is free, but SourceTree has been so buggy recently I am getting sick of it.
