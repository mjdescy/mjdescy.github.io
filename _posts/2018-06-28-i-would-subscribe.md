I would subscribe to [Apple Music + News + TV for $149/year](https://birchtree.me/blog/apple-entertainment-pricing-and-feature-speculation/) (or a little more for a family plan), but I'm a sucker for Apple products and services anyway. I would be a Texture subscriber _today_ if their app experience wasn't (in my opinion) terrible.
