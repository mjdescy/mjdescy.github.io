(My original title was just an expletive.)

[Body confirmed as missing Frightened Rabbit singer - BBC News](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44079462):

> "Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you", it added. 
> 
> "Scott battled bravely with his own issues for many years and we are immensely proud of him for being so open with his struggles.
>
> "His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues."

I'm so upset. I _love_ Frightened Rabbit. It was no secret that Scott Hutchison suffered from depression, anxiety, and who knows what else—it's _all over_ his arch, wry lyrics. Go listen to "[Keep Yourself Warm](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/keep-yourself-warm/917524230?i=917524306)" to get an idea of what a great singer/songwriter he was.
