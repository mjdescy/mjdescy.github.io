[Finland is letting its yearlong experiment with Universal Basic Income expire](https://nyti.ms/2HpHmQE). It turns out giving out tax money to people with no strings attached isn't widely popular. What is interesting to me, a US citizen, is this:

> This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant.
> 
> Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth.
> 
> “In a sense,” said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, “Finland already has basic income.”

I support Universal Basic Income. I think it would help the poor and would spur more people, like me, to start their own businesses. Of course, if we in the US had government provided healthcare, education, and job training programs, it might be enough to spur new business creation. I have the talent to start a consultancy, but the responsibility to pay for healthcare and my children's education has always made me feel more secure with a normal, salaried position.
