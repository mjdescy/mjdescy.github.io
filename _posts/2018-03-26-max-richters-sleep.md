I am unreasonably excited [to learn about](https://kottke.org/18/03/max-richters-sleep-an-8-hour-album-designed-to-be-listened-to-while-you-sleep) Max Richter's 8 1/2 hour album "[Sleep](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sleep/1358135251)". It is meant to be played all night long, as you sleep. What I have heard so far is quiet, relaxing, and beautiful. I doubt my wife would let us play it through the night while we sleep. But maybe we could play it instead of white noise for our kids.
