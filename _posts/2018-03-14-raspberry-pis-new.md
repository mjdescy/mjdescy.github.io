[Raspberry Pi's new model](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-model-bplus-sale-now-35/) is an unexpected Pi Day treat. I use two older Pis as specialized servers in my home: one for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/) and one for [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net). They are inexpensive and amazing. I’m not sure I will get the new one, though—I need even faster network speeds.
