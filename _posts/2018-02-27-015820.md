[SwiftoDo 2.9.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftodo-task-list-for-todo.txt/id1073798440?ls=1&mt=8) is now available in the App Store. It adds an edit mode for your todo.txt file, opens URL schemes for apps _other_ than Safari, and fixes more bugs. I pushed it out a bit early because I’m working on a fix for a longstanding bug that I’d love to get out at the end of the week.
