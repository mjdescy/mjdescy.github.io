Here are my top three divergent punctuation preferences, compared to everybody I have ever worked with:

1. [One space goes after a period](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/01/space_invaders.html).

2. Always use [the Oxford comma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma), for clarity and consistency.

3. Punctuation belongs _outside_ quotation marks ([British style](http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html)).
