I wanted a [remote temperature sensor for my Nest](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/15/17123822/nest-temperature-sensor-video-doorbell-smart-lock-price-features) _six years ago_. I've lived too long without it to feel like it is necessary now. The Nest has not noticeably improved since I got it. The best thing I did with it is set it up with Homebridge to use with Siri. It works faster and more reliably through that hack than through the official iOS and watchOS apps. I wish Neat, the company, had done better with it, but they seem to have lost interest in their initial product years ago.
