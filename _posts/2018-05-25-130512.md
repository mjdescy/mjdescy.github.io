[SwiftoDo 2.12.0](https://swiftodoapp.com) is now available [in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftodo-task-list-for-todo.txt/id1073798440?ls=1&mt=8).  New features include a default option for new tasks, and an option to retain priority when completing tasks. There are tons of under-the-hood improvements, too.
