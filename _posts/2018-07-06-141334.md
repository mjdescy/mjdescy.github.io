I'm happy to read [a favorable review of "Ant-Man and the Wasp”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/movies/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review-marvel-paul-rudd.html). I'm apt to see it because I enjoy the Marvel Universe movies and because I've seen the commercial for it about 15,000 times during MLB.TV baseball games.
