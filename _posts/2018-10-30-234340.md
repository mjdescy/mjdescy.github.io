[This article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/realestate/a-broadway-actor-has-a-heart-to-heart-about-life-and-laundry.html), about an actor's family finding an apartment as they move to NYC, is kind of depressing. It's unreasonably expensive to live in the city. If I were in his position, I would probably try to live outside the city a little ways.
