Last night my wife and I watched the Mr. Rogers documentary _[Won't You Be My Neighbor](http://focusfeatures.com/wont-you-be-my-neighbor/)_. It was wonderful and emotional film. Fred Rogers was a fascinating man. This [interview he did with Terry Gross in 1985](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1178498) is worth a listen, too.
