My wife and I are going to see â€œ[In the Heights](https://www.phoenixredbank.com/in-the-heights/)" tomorrow night, and I am super-psyched. If you only know of Lin-Manuel Miranda's "Hamilton", you would do well to listen to [his _other_ Best Musical Tony Award winner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-the-heights-original-broadway-cast-recording/1269639900).
