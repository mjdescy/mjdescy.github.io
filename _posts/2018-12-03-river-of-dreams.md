I'm not a _huge_ Billy Joel fan, though I do have all his albums and respect him as an artist. I wish he had written another album after _[River of Dreams](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/river-of-dreams/158619540)_, which I am listening to again today. I think that, as a maker of _albums_, rather than singles, he hit his stride with _Storm Front_ and that, _as an album_, _River of Dreams_ is his best. His earlier albums have higher highs and lower lows, and don't hold together as well, in my opinion. I prefer picking through his excellent _Greatest Hits_ collections rather than revisit the albums the songs come from.
