ðŸ“š I resumed reading [Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_of_Rivals) last night. It's an incredibly well-written and well-researched book. I had stopped reading it because I thought its subject matterâ€”the break-up of the United States due to intractable racial prejudiceâ€”hit a little too close to home for 2017-18. Regardless, I am now continuing.
