Listening to the cast recording of "[Frozen: The Broadway Musical](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/frozen-broadway-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1378411252)" for the first time is a bit surreal for me.  Compared to the movie, there are new songs, lyrics changes in existing songs, and, of course, different singers. I don't think any of the changes are for the better. It's hard to say for sure, though, because, as a parent of a little girl, I've heard the movie and the movie soundtrack about 1,000 times already, and it's burned into my brain.
