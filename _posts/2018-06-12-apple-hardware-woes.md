As much as I love Apple hardware, I've got a bunch of Apple hardware problems all of the sudden:

- AirPod battery life has dropped to less than an hour for phone calls. My AirPods are about 18 months old.
- Bad backlight bleed developed on the bottom edge of my iPad Pro. Dark backgrounds obscure it, but light backgrounds don't. I will see tomorrow if they will fix it under warranty. My iPad Pro is 11 months old.
- A bright spot developed in the bottom right corner of my iPhone 7 Plus. You can only see it when that section of the screen is displaying white. I'll ask about it at the Genius Bar tomorrow. My iPhone is almost 20 months old. Luckily, it's still covered by AppleCare+.
- My 2013 MacBook Pro started dropping my USB trackball upon or after going to sleep. I have to unplug and replug it to make it work again. Research has shown me that this sort of thing is one of those unknown bugs. I hope it doesn't mean my logic board is going. 

These are all minor quibbles, but they are all about rather expensive hardware. I think I'm going to start buying AppleCare+ from now on.
