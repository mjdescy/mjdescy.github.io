I have been seriously considering holding on to my iPhone 7 Plus for a third year. I just got a new screen and a new battery, It looks almost brand new, I still like the camera, I never complain about it being slow, and iOS 12 promises to improve performance when I upgrade to it. I feel the same way about my Series 1 Apple Watch, too, though my desire to upgrade it to whatever model Apple releases next is still a lot higher.
