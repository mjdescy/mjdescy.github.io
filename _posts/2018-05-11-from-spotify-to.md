I enjoyed this interview with Swift expert, blogger, and podcaster John Sundell ([@johnsundell](https://micro.blog/johnsundell)): 
[From Spotify to Indie and Beyond: A Top Dev Interview With John Sundell](https:/z/www.raywenderlich.com/192589/from-spotify-to-indie-and-beyond-a-top-dev-interview-with-john-sundell). I have learned a lot from John's weekly blog, [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com), in the past year or so, and always enjoy his contributions to the Swift programming community.
