I am enjoying “The Last Jedi” a lot more on the second viewing. I didn’t like it when I first saw it in the theatre, for a dozen different reasons. But now I get it in a way I hadn’t. Some things I thought were annoying, like Po’s actions, were _supposed_ to be. The whole movie is about learning from failure, and is well structured around that theme.
