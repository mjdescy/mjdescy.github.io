Do Windows fans care about Microsoft's earnings? Do Android fans care about Google's? I wonder if the main reason Apple fans (non-investors) [cheer on Apple's good earnings reports](https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/05/apple-quarterly-results-charts-live-tweets/) is that Apple almost went out of business in the 1990s. Unless the company is going out of business, or if you have tied a lot of your money up with them somehow, who cares about its quarterly earnings report?
