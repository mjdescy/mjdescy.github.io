[This article about “Jane Walker” scotch](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2018/02/26/thanks-to-jane-walker-ladies-can-finally-drink-scotch/?utm_term=.89044419905e) is hilarious. As ham-handed as Johnny Walker’s marketing campaign is, I think that more women _should_ drink scotch, because scotch is great. 🏴🥃 The Jane Walker logo looks great, too.
