ðŸŽµ Taking a trip down memory lane with Guster's [Keep It Together](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/keep-it-together/1586602) this evening, on my MacBook Pro and Oppo PM-3's ðŸŽ§. Their records are cleanly produced, tightly written, and tastefully played. When I saw them _live_, though, they absolutely shredded their way through their songs. They were freaking amazing.
