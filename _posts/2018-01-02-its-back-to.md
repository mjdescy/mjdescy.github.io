It's back to work for me today, and I a digging out of my email inbox. Sometime later I will add a new "2018" folder to my "[file system for life](http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-02-file-folder-structure-for-life.html)", the filing system I wrote about in [Plaintext Productivity](http://plaintext-productivity.net) several years ago. It feels good, each year, to marvel at how many project folders I created last year, leave them behind, and to prepare a clean space for new work.
