Today, Apple's US App Store is highlighting two great games that are among the best on the platform:

- [Game of the Day: Goblin Sword](https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1356375657). Goblin Sword plays like a AAA title from the 16-bit days, and has great play control, difficulty, and variety. It's fantastic.
- [Games Are Art: The Beauty of Oddmar](https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1369365671). I learned about Oddmar from someone else on micro.blog, and have only played through a handful of levels. The play controls are unique and well suited for the iPhone, and the graphics and sound are amazing. It's a fun and funny game.
