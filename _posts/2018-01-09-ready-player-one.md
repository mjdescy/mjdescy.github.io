I just finished _Ready Player One_ by Ernest Cline ðŸ“š . It was light and enjoyable the whole way through. I'm not sure just how much I liked it, as reading it was a little like watching somebody else play video games, which is not really my thing, but I did like it. I'm glad the author addressed the isolation of all the main characters in real life, at least a little. It could have had more depth in that area, but that might have diminished its charm.
