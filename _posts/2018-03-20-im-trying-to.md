🎵 I'm trying to form an opinion of The Decemberists' new album, "[I'll Be Your Girl](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ill-be-your-girl/1333620066)”. I haven't gotten my mind around it quite yet. Has it really been 7 years since “[The King Is Dead](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-king-is-dead/715554884)”!?
