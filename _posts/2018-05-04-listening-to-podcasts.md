I am _so_ accustomed to listening to Podcasts with [Overcast](https://overcast.fm)'s "Voice Boost" feature that, when I turn it off (as I'm doing today, because my Bluetooth headphones are too loud) my podcasts sound flat and lifeless.

I wonder, though, why more podcast producers don't run their episodes through dynamic compression and EQ filters ("Voice Boost") prior to publishing. For that matter, why don't they "shorten silences" on their end, too? That way, everyone could benefit from better audio quality and a shorter runtime. I suspect that some of big, radio-show-based podcasts do, but it's obvious that most other podcasts don't.
