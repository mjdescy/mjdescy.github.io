I found out that Toad the Wet Sproket re-recorded their greatest hits from the 1990s. [All You Want](https://toadthewetsprocket.bandcamp.com/album/all-you-want) was released in 2011. It’s unusual for a band to re-record songs _in the studio_ (live albums are another thing entirely). I found it enjoyable to listen to, though I’m not sure why they did it. The production is more modern—read, a lot louder, but with a larger soundstage—but the songs aren’t re-interpreted or anything.

Texas did this, too, with [Texas 25](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_25), which marked their 25th anniversary as a band. Texas reinterpreted some of their songs, though. That album sounds great and is worth a listen.
