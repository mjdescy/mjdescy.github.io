Switching my default search engine from Google to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) this week has been painless. Search results are great (I'm missing nothing by not using Google), and I like it a lot better than Bing. It feels a lot like Google used to, back when Google was focused on searching—you know—_the web_, rather than Google's own interpretation of the web. You can also customize its look and feel, and even hide its own ads, which is _crazy_. So far, I'm very happy.
