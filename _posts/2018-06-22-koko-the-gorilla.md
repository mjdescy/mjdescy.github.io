[Koko the Gorilla](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/koko-gorilla-death-sign-language.html) was a subject of fascination for me as a child. But, like many my age, I suspect, I kind of forgot about her, except for when she popped up in college psychology textbooks or NY Times crosswork clues every so often. I'm embarassed to say that I didn't know Koko was still alive for most of my life. Rest in peace.
