I checked out the new MacBook Pros at the Apple Store. The new keyboard looks (feels) like a winner to me. It is quieter, and there's a good chance it won't have the same reliability problem as the prior generation. I would prefer a 15" one without the TouchBar, though, but don't plan to buy one until my 2015 rMBP breaks or is no longer supported.
