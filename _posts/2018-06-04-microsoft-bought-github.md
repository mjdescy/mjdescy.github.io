[Microsoft bought GitHub](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal) just in time for WWDC to bury the news. I get the feeling that whatever led to GitHub's success will soon be lost, but that it won't matter to its profitability, and the vast majority of projects hosted there will stay. It just will never be the *next* GitHub.
