It's a speed run in our kitchen tonight. My wife and daughter are rushing to make mini muffin batter and put it in the oven before bath time—in 20 minutes total. That would be a speed record for them. 🏁 And…the [muffin mixing method](https://pastrychefonline.com/2009/01/27/the-muffin-method/) just got kicked by the wayside. 😂
