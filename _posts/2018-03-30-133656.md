[SwiftoDo 2.11.1](https://swiftodoapp.com) is now available [in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftodo-task-list-for-todo.txt/id1073798440?ls=1&mt=8). It improves hardware keyboard support in the task list and task editor. Now you can type the first character to make picking priority, project, and context faster.
