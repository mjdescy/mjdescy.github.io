Unpopular opinion: [Calendars 5](https://readdle.com/products/calendars5) is better than [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone). I have had both on my iOS devices for years and finally chose _just one_ today. I prefer how Calendars 5 handles tasks and how it displays the results of natural language parsing, which is just as good as Fantastical's.
