ðŸŽµ I'm listening to a bunch of different versions of what is probably the greatest Bossa nova song ever: "[Aguas de Marco](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/%C3%A1guas-de-marco/263743484?i=263743529)"/"[Waters of March](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-waters-of-march/152819588?i=152819611)". It's lovely and hypnotic.
