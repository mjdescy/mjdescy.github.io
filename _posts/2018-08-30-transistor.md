I finished the game [Transistor](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/) last night. I played it on my iPad Pro with a MFi controller.

It was a fun game with a great atmosphere (setting, sound design, visual design, etc.) but the story was a bit too opaque for my taste. You had to dig into the user interface and read a bunch of optional stuff to get a better idea of what is going on ints its disintegrating cyberpunk world.

It ended kind of abruptly _and_ had a tragic ending, which is unusual, but maybe not for the [game studio](https://www.supergiantgames.com/). Their prior game, [Bastion](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/bastion/), also had kind of a downer ending. 

I'm not sure if I will do a replay of Transister, but I'm happy that I played it.
