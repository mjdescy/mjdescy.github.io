[Android Creator Puts Essential Up for Sale, Cancels Next Phone - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/andy-rubin-s-phone-maker-essential-is-said-to-consider-sale)

> Current discussions are focused on a sale of the entire company, including its patent portfolio, hardware products like the original smartphone, an upcoming smart home device and a camera attachment for the phone, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.

I got an Essential Phone in its release date, and was optimistic that the company would succeed. It looks like it hasn't. Their first phone _did_ have a bad camera experience (hardware and software-wise), which probably prevented any chance of success from the start. The Pixel and the Galaxy phones put it to shame. Plus, it must be next to impossible to make money selling Android phones. It's not a business I would want to be in.
