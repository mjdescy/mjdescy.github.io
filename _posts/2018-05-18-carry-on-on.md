On this bad and sad news day, remember:

> If you're lost and alone  
> Or you're sinking like a stone  
> Carry on  
> May your past be the sound  
> Of your feed upon the ground and  
> Carry on  
>   
> 'Cause we are, we are shining stars  
> We are invincible  
> We are who we are  
> On our darkest day  
> When we're miles away  
> So we'll come, we will find our way home

Fun.'s "Carry On" works well, and feels quite different, in [this cover version by the cast of "Rise"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/carry-on-feat-shannon-purser-rise-cast-version/1382637611?i=1382638029).
