[Transistor on iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/hr/app/transistor/id948857526?mt=8) is a really good game. I started it around 11 PM last night and completely lost track of time until 12:30 AM. I am still doing pretty well with gaming on my iPad Pro with a controller, rather than buying a Nintendo Switch.
