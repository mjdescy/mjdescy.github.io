Tonight I set up [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) on an otherwise unused Raspberry Pi to control my Nest thermostat via Siri and HomeKit. The hardest part for me was getting it set up as a service, because I hadn't used [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) before. I blame/thank FreeBSD for that!
