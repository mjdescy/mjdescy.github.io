[Apple buying Texture](https://512pixels.net/2018/03/apple-buys-texture-the-digital-magazine-service/) is interesting and unexpected to me. I subscribed to Texture for a couple weeks and did not like it because I found it too hard to read on my iPad and iPhone. Basically, for most of the magazines it offers, it provides you _images_ of magazines, with their crazy layouts and scads of advertisements, rather than access to the magazine's website content. It was like reading a PDF rather than a webpage. The small text size, traditional print magazine layout, and the need to pan around the page made the reading experience very poor. Since it _looked good_, I am not sure if Apple will spend much time improving it, even though it was impossible to use.
