[Amazon is increasing the price of Prime membership](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/amazon-doubles-its-profit---and-hikes-prime-membership-by-20/2018/04/26/31f5a14c-489a-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html?utm_term=.ff2227bbf7cb):

> Amazon also said it will hike its Prime membership fee 20 percent to $119 a year for new members beginning May 11. Existing members who renew their Prime memberships will have to pay the new rate beginning June 16.

Perversely, this news is making me want to buy _more_ from them, to get a better value on shipping. I bet Amazon is expecting that response from some of their most loyal customers.
