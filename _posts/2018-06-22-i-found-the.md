I found the article published last week that links to my iOS to-do app, [SwiftoDo](https://swiftodoapp.com), my old todo.txt Mac client (buy [SwiftoDo Desktop](https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop) instead) and to my [plaintext productivity](https://plaintext-productivity.net) website as well: [Every To-Do List App Sucks, Switch To todo.txt Instead](https://www.howtogeek.com/355890/every-to-do-list-app-sucks-switch-to-todo.txt-instead/) 😀
