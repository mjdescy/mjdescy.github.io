I still use [GRC Perfect Passwords](https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm) _all the time_ to create new, randomly generated passwords--mostly because LastPass does not do a good job interacting with various website login forms. (I understand that is a challenge, especially when people like me run content blockers.) If anything, LastPass seems to work worse for me that it did a couple years ago.
