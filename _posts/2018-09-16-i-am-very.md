It is not an _exciting_ upgrade, I guess, but it is a solid one. Everything works. Everything is stable. Dark mode looks great and is useful. The Dock now has a second divider between pinned apps and running, non-pinned apps, which I like. Performance is just as good as with High Sierra on my 5-year-old MacBook Pro. All in all, macOS is a mature OS with a great amount of polish. While not exciting, and not substantially different from its predecessors, it represents the pinnacle of desktop operating systems (and shells).
