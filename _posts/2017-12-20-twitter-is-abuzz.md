Twitter is abuzz about [UIKit, perhaps, going to the Mac late next year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps). We'll see. I would love to code a new version of my todo.txt app, SwiftoDo Desktop, in UIKit rather than AppKit. The different table view model is a big factor in that, though UIKit's window and split view controls are, of course, different, too. WWDC will be especially interesting next year.
