[Slate pushed a redesign today](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/why-we-redesigned-slate.html). I used to love Slate, but I'm afraid I aged out of its target audience or it drifted away from me, because it doesn't seem as smart to me anymore. I still love the [Political Gabfest](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gabfest.html) though.
