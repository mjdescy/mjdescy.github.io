I both love and hate articles like "[The New York Yankees Are a Moral Abomination](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/opinion/new-york-yankees-evil.html)". Handwringing, declinist arguments about baseball are almost as old as baseball itself. "Baseball is in decline" is part of its brandâ€”part that needs to go away, I think. 

Baseball is awesome. The players are very skillful, play a game that doesn't involve hurting each other, and legitimately appear to be enjoying themselves.
