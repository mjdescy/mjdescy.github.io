I am sad that [Exponent](https://exponent.fm/episode-155-the-end-for-now/), one of my favorite podcasts, has entered an indefinite, and maybe permanent, hiatus. Ben Thompson and James Allsworth had great insights into technology and business. Listening to them made me feel like I was in business school again, but with two of the smartest professors (or maybe classmates) in the room.
