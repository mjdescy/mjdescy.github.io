I have to decide if I'm going to end it, roll it forward month-to-month via an App Store subscription, or pay for an ultimately cheaper annual subscription via Marvel's web site. I thought, for fun, I would start reading one comic book per day, and think that justifies the subscription price. I am enjoying the service, but I have, historically, only read comics in short, intense bursts every couple years, so I'm not sure if I will really stick with it once I read through the series I started. Of course, now I'm hooked on Brian Michael Bendis's run of _All-New X-Men_, so I predict I will renew the subscription in some way.
