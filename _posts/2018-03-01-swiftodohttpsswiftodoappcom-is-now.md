[SwiftoDo](https://swiftodoapp.com) 2.9.1 is [now available in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftodo-task-list-for-todo.txt/id1073798440?ls=1&mt=8). It fixes a longstanding Dropbox-related bug that caused a crash on startup for some users. Bonus feature: the task editor now recognizes new projects and contexts and adds them to their respective pickers.
