Reviewing [macOS 10.14 Mojave System Requirements](https://512pixels.net/2018/06/macos-10-14-mojave-system-requirements/) makes me think I _may_ only have one year of useful life left on my 2013 MacBook Pro. (Mid 2012 MacBook Pros are the oldest supported.) 

If that's true, it will be disappointing to me, because my laptop still feels fast and has plenty of computing resources. As a developer, I need to keep abreast of the current OS changes though, so I will have to upgrade when OS support is dropped.
