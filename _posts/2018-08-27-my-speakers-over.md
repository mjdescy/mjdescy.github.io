While I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems. My goal was to trace my journey from a normal person to an audiophile, as I upgrade my gear up over the years.

7. [Philips Revolution Motorized Portable Speaker Dock for iPhone/iPod](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/16/philips-revolution-motorized-portable-speaker-dock-for-iphoneipod/)
8. [Altec Lansing M650 iPod Speaker Dock](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/17/altec-lansing-m650-ipod-speaker-dock/)

The speakers that I have had are nothing special, but they are special, in a way, to me, because of all the music I listened to through them.

I plan to write another, hopefully more interesting, series about my various headphones in the near future.
