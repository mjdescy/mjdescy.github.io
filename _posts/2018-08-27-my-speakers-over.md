While I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems. My goal was to trace my journey from a normal person to an audiophile, as I upgrade my gear up over the years.

1. [Speakers over the years](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/10/speakers-over-the-years/)
2. [My first speaker system](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/11/my-first-speaker-system/)
3. [Sony CFD 510 Boombox](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/12/sony-cfd-510-boombox/)
4. [My first computer speakers](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/13/my-first-computer-speakers/)
5. [Altec Lansing computer speakers](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/14/altec-lansing-computer-speakers-for-dell/)
6. [Harman Kardon Soundsticks II Speaker System](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/15/harman-kardon-soundsticks-ii-speaker-system/)
7. [Philips Revolution Motorized Portable Speaker Dock for iPhone/iPod](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/16/philips-revolution-motorized-portable-speaker-dock-for-iphoneipod/)
8. [Altec Lansing M650 iPod Speaker Dock](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/17/altec-lansing-m650-ipod-speaker-dock/)

The speakers that I have had are nothing special, but they are special, in a way, to me, because of all the music I listened to through them.

I plan to write another, hopefully more interesting, series about my various headphones in the near future.
