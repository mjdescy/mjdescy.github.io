I learned of a service that makes RSS feeds out of Twitter users' tweets: [TwitRSS.me](https://www.twitrss.me). I added some noteworthy users to my feeds in [Reeder](http://reederapp.com), so I don't miss their tweets, but also don't have to go to Twitter to get them. Does anyone know what _the best_ Twitter/RSS service is?
