		<h1><a href="/2018/11/30/my-micro-camera.html">My Micro 4/3 Camera is all kitted out</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I have just about every accessory I would imagine I would need for my (still) new Olympus OM-D EM10 Mark III camera, and all of them, except for the little carrying case it came with and my AmazonBasics tripod, fit into this little box. I never expected to buy so many lenses in such a short time (over a 4-month period). I was having so much fun shooting photos and expanding my camera‚Äôs versatility. I tracked lens prices closely for months and bought each lens on a price dip; all in all I saved hundreds of dollars, compared to what it would have cost if I bought everything up front. Still, I spent way too much money this year on the camera; but at least I‚Äôm almost done.</p>

<p>To keep everything neat and tidy, rather than lumped together in a little box, I think want some kind of padded, hardshell case for everything (such as a Pelican case). I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth the expense, though, because I don‚Äôt think I would ever take it out of the house. I would continue to use the little case that came with the camera, which I love for its small size. It easily fits the camera and an extra lens or an external flash unit.</p>

<p>Once I sort the case situation out, I will be done with camera spending‚Ä¶at least for a few years.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/11/29/kodex-an-ios.html">Kodex: An iOS code/text editor I just discovered</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I just discovered a versatile code (and text) editor for iOS called <a href="https://kodex.app">Kodex</a>. It is a free app with some pretty cool features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tight integration with the Files app</li>
  <li>syntax highlighting for numerous languages (including Markdown)</li>
  <li>multiple tabbed interface</li>
  <li>a large assortment of hardware keyboard shortcuts, which you can customize the key bindings for</li>
  <li>multiple cursor support (it‚Äôs more rudimentary than Sublime Text‚Äôs, which works with ‚Äúnext word‚Äù selection and the mouse, but it‚Äôs a desktop-only app)</li>
  <li>find/replace</li>
  <li>find/replace with regEx</li>
  <li>document minimap</li>
  <li>a large assortment of themes and color schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>As nice as iOS is for text editing, especially if you have a hardware keyboard, it is hard to not see just how rudimentary most of its text editors are. There certainly is nothing like BBEdit or Sublime Text available on the platform (though Kodex is definitely aiming at Sublime Text, in its functionality).</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt even think of any iOS text editor, other than Kodex (which I just discovered), that supports working with documents in multiple tabs.  (Apple should really just make a Safari-like tab bar controller a standard component. I know I would use it in my apps.) Even features that are common on the desktop, like find and replace, have only become common on iOS in the past year or so.</p>

<p>The best text editors on the platform (such as Drafts) are made with MarkDown and automation in mind, which is cool. But they are simplistic compared to what is available on the desktop. I would love it if something as fast and versatile as Sublime Text was released on iOS. I would probably pay a lot of money for it, too.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/11/28/removing-dropbox-and.html">Removing Dropbox, and Finding a Replacement for Editorial on iOS</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I‚Äôm working on retiring Dropbox from all my systems. For personal files, I am all in on iCloud. For work files, which I want separate, I am going to use OneDrive (which is IT-supported). I am stuck, though, trying to figure out what text (and Markdown) editor I can use on iOS that will be acceptable to me. Pretext crashes on long files, but is otherwise OK. 1Writer is OK, but had trouble opening some of my files, and I don‚Äôt like its floating buttons. There are so many decent Dropbox-enabled text editors on iOS, but very few that integrate well with the Files app.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Most of my cooking and cleaning plans today were derailed when my kitchen sink detached from the granite countertop. I was soaking oven racks in scalding hot water, which I do every year around this time, but this time the weight and the heat were too much. The sink‚Äôs seaI failed, and the sink dropped about an inch on one side. I had to bail gallons of hot water out with a bowl. Luckily, I was able to get it repaired about an hour later, but I can‚Äôt use the sink again until sometime tomorrow. At least this didn‚Äôt happen to me on Thanksgiving!</p>
