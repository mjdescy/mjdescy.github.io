      <div class="e-content"><p>I finished the game <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/">Transistor</a> last night. I played it on my iPad Pro with a MFi controller.</p>

<p>It was a fun game with a great atmosphere (setting, sound design, visual design, etc.) but the story was a bit too opaque for my taste. You had to dig into the user interface and read a bunch of optional stuff to get a better idea of what is going on ints its disintegrating cyberpunk world.</p>

<p>It ended kind of abruptly <em>and</em> had a tragic ending, which is unusual, but maybe not for the <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/">game studio</a>. Their prior game, <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/bastion/">Bastion</a>, also had kind of a downer ending.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I will do a replay of Transister, but I’m happy that I played it.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Articles like <a href="https://nyti.ms/2o6XKJH?smid=nytcore-ios-share">this one from the New York Times</a> are meant to be inspiring, I think. But learning how a CEO manages his time is not that valuable for any non-CEO to learn about, simply because a CEO doesn’t have a boss whose demands and whims make time management impossible sometimes. What makes time management difficult—and stressful—is not just whatever the workload is: it is <em>lack of control</em> over your schedule, location, and what you are doing. I’d rather hear about people 1-3 levels down from the CEO about how they manage their time. Their stories would be more relatable, though they would sell fewer papers.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Today felt like a good day to listen to a long vocal jazz playlist through my V Moda Crossfade Wireless 2. Their warm, somewhat bass-y sound signature works surprisingly well for that genre. I mostly think of them as great for rock and pop music, but they handled sparse arrangements of vocals (male and female), piano, bass, and drums (mostly brushwork) surprisingly well.</p>

<p>I had to use wired mode because the Bluetooth connection is too loud for me, even at the lowest volume setting, on my iOS devices. The Bluetooth volume level appears to be more sane when I use them with my Apple TV or Mac.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/08/26/i-miss-apples.html">I miss Apple's Aperture</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>What <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-history-of-aperture/">Stephen Hackett’s piece</a> says about Apple’s Aperture—mainly about its shortcomings—may be true, it does not reflect that, from a UI standpoint, Aperture was a masterpiece. From not locking you into specific modes or workflows, to having sensible single-key keyboard shortcuts for nearly every command, it was an absolute joy to use. I used it for almost its entire product lifespan.</p>

<p>When Apple announced its end of life, I tried to move to Adobe Lightroom, and just hated it. I stuck with Aperture until over a year into the life of Apple’s current Photos app. I still miss Aperture’s editing tools, and would really be sore about it if my digital cameras today were as bad as the ones I had back in 2005-2011.</p>

<p>Apple Photos is a decent replacement now that it has gone through several iterations. I <em>really</em> wish it had retouching support on the iPad, though. (It is current Mac-only.)</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/08/23/i-fixed-a.html">I fixed a crash. Now I am a golden god! 🧜‍♂️</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I fixed the SwiftoDo chrasher that I griped about this afternoon, and, to future-me’s chagrin, I stayed up late to do it.</p>

<p>Tracking down the problem was tricky, but I eventually discovered that <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIDocument</code>’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">revert</code> method was failing because sometimes it was being executed on a closed file. It turns out that I was not interrogating <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIDocument.documentState</code> correctly when checking for “closed” file state. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">documentState</code> property is an OptionSet, and has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">contains</code> method that is more appropriate to use than <code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>At least, that what I think right now. I’ll test my app out for a day or two and see if the nasty crash bug rears its head again, or moves to a new call site.</p>

I am enjoying the service, but I have, historically, only read comics in short, intense bursts every couple years, so I’m not sure if I will really stick with it once I read through the series I started. Of course, now I’m hooked on Brian Michael Bendis’s run of <em>All-New X-Men</em>, so I predict I will renew the subscription in some way.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="http://joe-steel.com/2018-08-20-First-Time-Tooter-Long-Time-Tweeter.html">This blog post</a> is a great overview of Mastodon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In conversations I’ve had over the past week, it’s become clear that there’s nothing very self-explanatory about Mastodon as a social network, and that in many ways Twitter users are both prepared and unprepared for the experience. There are a lot of things that are similar in concept, but there’s more to it when it comes to how it’s a “service” that can really throw people for a loop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use Mastodon <em>a little</em>, but don’t really feel strongly one way or another towards the platform. I <em>want</em> to like it more. I was super enthusiastic about its predecessors, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_social">StatusNet</a> (nee Laconica, now GNU Social), but those failed to gain significant momentum, and became overrun with spam.</p>

<p>Despite whatever is new and exciting about Mastodon’s web UI, open web features, etc., it doesn’t feel that new or exciting to me. It feels like a better StatusNet. I suppose, though, that I care more about writing and posting content, and owning it, than about the ephemeral and chatty aspects of social networking.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/08/20/204134.html">It looks like iOS 12 will extend the life of my old iOS hardware</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I bought my iPad Air 2 almost a year after it was released, only a few months before the first iPad Pro was released. I was a little worried at the time that I would get only a couple years out of it before iOS updates rendered it obsolete. I have been pleasantly surprised that that day has not yet arrived—and, based on how the iOS 12 beta is running, that day will not arrive for at least another year.</p>

<p>Last night, I finally installed the iOS 12 beta on it, and found the new OS to be smooth, stable, and fast. All my apps (even the ones I wrote!) are working just fine. As Apple promised, UI and animation-related things like scrolling are visibly faster and smoother, too.</p>

<p>I plan to install iOS 12 beta on my iPhone 7 Plus in early September, after I complete my next release of <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a>. Based what I’m seeing, performance wise, on my even-older iPad Air 2, I’m looking forward to at least one more year of service from my iPhone 7 Plus, too. (It helps that my phone has a brand new battery and a new screen, thanks to AppleCare Plus.)</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Dark Sky released a ground-up <a href="https://blog.darksky.net/the-new-dark-sky-app/">rewrite of their flagship iOS app</a> today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most noticeable change is the introduction of a new unified timeline. Rather than separating the forecast onto multiple pages, we now combine the current conditions, next hour rain forecast, next 24 hours, and next week forecasts into a single scrollable view that lets you quickly get to the part of the forecast you care about. This makes it much easier to scan what will happen in the minutes, hours, and days ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dark Sky version 1.0, which was singularly focused on precipitation warnings and maps for your immediate vicinity, was probably my favorite iteration of the app. It wasn’t a full-fledged weather app at the time, but its singular focus was useful for me whenever I wanted to step out of the house or office.</p>

<p>I have been using Weather Line, which uses Dark Sky weather data, almost exclusively for the past couple years, because its information layout was denser and more useful. This update may bring me back to Dark Sky, however. I’m moving it back to my home screen and will give it a go.</p>
