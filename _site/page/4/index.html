<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon also said it will hike its Prime membership fee 20 percent to $119 a year for new members beginning May 11. Existing members who renew their Prime memberships will have to pay the new rate beginning June 16.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perversely, this news is making me want to buy <em>more</em> from them, to get a better value on shipping. I bet Amazon is expecting that response from some of their most loyal customers.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/26/mac-apps-are.html">Mac apps are harder than iOS apps</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I agree with Matt Ronge’s article “<a href="https://medium.com/astro-hq/mac-apps-are-harder-than-ios-apps-614338e2e470">Mac apps are harder than iOS apps</a>”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was surprised when a recent project brought me back to the Mac and I discovered how finicky Cocoa really is. I was particularly shocked because I always remembered Cocoa as a particularly nice set of APIs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, a <em>big</em> problem that Mr. Ronge does not mention is that there is very little information available online to help a macOS developer work through anything but the most basic situations. Sure, you can find some tutorials on <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/macos">raywenderlich.com</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDg-YmnNehm3KB0BpytkUJg">YouTube</a>, but once you go beyond the basics, good information is hard to find.</p>

<p>If you search for “How do I do X? on iOS” you will likely find dozens or hundreds of hits, including numerous tutorials, open source libraries, and Stack Overflow questions. Conversely, you will be lucky to find one or two resources for the query “How do I do X? on macOS” (or OS X).</p>

<p>It is understandable, because iOS is such a huge platform, but it is also quite frustrating, at least to a solo developer like me. If Apple creates <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps">a new framework</a> or shim layer to let us use iOS frameworks on macOS, I think it would make making Mac apps a lot easier for predominantly iOS-oriented developers like me..</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/26/blocker-x.html">1Blocker X</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I picked up <a href="https://1blocker.com/">1Blocker X</a> based on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/1blocker-x-for-ios-review/">this review from John Voorhies on MacStores</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first thing you will notice when you set up 1Blocker X on an iOS device is its 7 toggles in Safari’s Content Blocker section of the Settings app. It’s a bit of a head-scratcher at first until you realize that this is what allows 1Blocker X to expand beyond the confines of its predecessor.</p>

  <p>You see, iOS limits the number of blocking rules that can be implemented by an app to 50,000. That’s a lot of rules, but sadly not enough given the amount of junk on the Internet these days. As a result, it’s a limit that 1Blocker began to run into not long after it launched in 2015.</p>

  <p>Finding a way around that hard limit required a rewrite of 1Blocker from the ground up. The result is 1Blocker X, an app with around three times as many blocking rules, room to grow, and enhanced flexibility for applying those rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think I really needed to replace the content blocker I had been using, but it hadn’t been updated in a really long time, so I’m not sure it’s blocking rules are up-to-date.</p>

<p>Much of the work these things do is invisilble. It’s easy to see if ads are blocked, of course, but not so with trackers and malware, which I care more about. At home I <em>also</em> block ads at the DNS level using <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>, running on an old Raspberry Pi. I heartily recommend setting up a Pi-hole (it’s easy; there are tutorials to follow). I miss having it when I’m out of the house, which is why a content blocker is helpful, too.</p>

<p>So far, 1Blocker X has been working just fine. I’ve noticed no decrease in speed from Safari, despite the crazy amount of blocking rules I have enabled.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/23/airpods-batteries-drain.html">AirPods batteries drain much faster on phone calls</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I thought my AirPods batteries were already aging out of their useful life span, due to quick draining on numerous hour long phone calls today and last week. It turns out, talk time is only “up to 2 hours”, while listening time (my main use case) is 2 1/2 times that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mmef2am/a/airpods">Per Apple</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AirPods (single charge): Up to 5 hours listening time,(2) Up to 2 hours talk time(5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So…phew! I’m more worried about having to replace them after less than two years due to a battery issue than about shorter battery life on calls.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I am enjoying using <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac/">Tower</a> over Atlassian SourceTree. <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">SourceTree</a> has many, many features, and is free to use, but it has some puzzling bugs that never seem to get fixed. For example, it never deletes branches via Git Flow, no matter how many times I try to reconfigure it.</p>

<p>Tower is faster, works better, and has a clean UI that fits in on the Mac very well. When I emailed Tower support about something, they responded almost instantly. That sold it for me. When the Tower 3 beta expires, I will be purchasing a license.</p>
