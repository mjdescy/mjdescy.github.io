      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://nyti.ms/2q5d7oj">This article</a> inspired me to install <a href="https://gethiya.app.link/phone-guard">Hiya</a> on my iPhone to block spam calls. I will find out eventually how well it works. I get 5-10 robocalls per week, mostly from the same exchange as my mobile number or my Google Voice number.</p>

<p>It seems to rely on a central service for all blocking rules, including an optional whitelist for your contacts and an optional rule based on your phone number for ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù spam. It can identify and block a gigantic list of known spammers and robocallers, which is beyond what I need.</p>

<p>Having looked at it, and its competition, it seems like there isn‚Äôt a good on-device-only call blocker for the super-privacy conscious who, like me, only want to whitelist contacts and blacklist all other numbers in a couple of area codes and exchanges. I really want to write one. It would have to be free, I think, based on the free competition out there‚Äîbut it may fit a particular niche that is out there.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I haven‚Äôt thought about this in a long time, but I am actually surprised that <a href="https://plus.google.com">Google Plus</a> still exists. Considering how many products Google launches and kills each year for practically no reason, it‚Äôs astounding that one of its monumental flops has been allowed to limp along for so many years. I think it must still be around because either it still generates signals for Google (how many though, compared to other things?), or because it was tied in, at a technical level, to more valuable and integral services like Gmail. All I know is that its continued presence in the Google portfolio serves as yet another reminder to me about how unfocused Google is as an organization.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>According to my Account page, this is my 300th post on Micro.blog. I thought I would share some stats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Micro.blog posts: 300</li>
  <li>Days on the platform: 136 (joined 2017-12-19)</li>
  <li>Average posts per day: 2.2</li>
  <li>How many people I follow: 131</li>
  <li>How many people follow me: I have no idea, and that is fine</li>
  <li>How much engagement I get from other users: a pleasingly good amount</li>
  <li>How much I happily paid Manton for Micro.blog hosting thus far: $30 USD ($5/month, not including the free trial period)</li>
  <li>How little I could have paid, if I wanted: $0 for a WordPress.com blog or $1/month for an inexpensive WordPress host, plus the free Micro.blog account</li>
</ul>

<p>Micro.blog has gotten me into blogging again after a long time away from it. I enjoy owning my own content, the focus on <em>writing</em> rather than liking or retweeting, and, most of all, the lack of <em>friction</em> in the platform.  Posting short or long form content is as simple as can be, and I don‚Äôt have a WordPress install and/or server to maintain.</p>

<p>I am having fun on the platform and look forward to continuing to do so.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/groundhog-day-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1215389487">Groundhog Day</a></em> is my second favorite Broadway musical of last year (closely behind ‚ÄúDear Evan Hansen‚Äù, which has more plot-related problems but really terrific music), and the only one I saw. I revisit the cast album from time to time, because it is terrific, and multiple listens reveal hidden depth in the earthy lyrics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-CD-Review-GROUNDHOG-DAY-THE-MUSICAL-Original-Broadway-Cast-Recording-is-Charmingly-Animated-20170516">Broadway World‚Äôs review of the cast album</a> is remarkably spot on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On first listen, Minchin‚Äôs melodies are captivating. They are undeniably more poppy than his dark, moody, and undulating score for MATILDA; however, it‚Äôs obvious that he has written each of these compositions with the same consideration and care that he did with MATILDA. Despite the more simplistic sounding and pop aural soundscape, the melodies are intricately layered showing an artistry and skill that is not apparent in one listening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope Tim Minchin keeps writing musicals. His music and lyrics for his prior show, <em>Matilda</em>, are a masterpiece. (Listen to the London cast recording over the Broadway one if you can; it is a <em>far</em> better performance, though it is missing some of Matilda‚Äôs monologues.) ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite rank as a masterpiece in my book, but it is really, really good.</p>

<p>I wonder, though, why more podcast producers don‚Äôt run their episodes through dynamic compression and EQ filters (‚ÄúVoice Boost‚Äù) prior to publishing. For that matter, why don‚Äôt they ‚Äúshorten silences‚Äù on their end, too? That way, everyone could benefit from better audio quality and a shorter runtime. I suspect that some of big, radio-show-based podcasts do, but it‚Äôs obvious that most other podcasts don‚Äôt.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>The annual <a href="https://panic.com/blog/the-2017-panic-report/">Panic Report</a> is always worth a read. I use a lot of their apps, and have long considered them an app studio so talented that I will buy whatever they make, so long as I can sometimes use it. They are refreshingly open and honest about their business, too. Their annual reports are especially eye opening if you are a developer and are curious about the business aspects of the App Store.</p>

<p>I thought this part, toward the end, was kind of funny.</p>

  <p>Absolutely not. This is so potentially powerful, we even made a video about it!</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt install Dropbox on my Mac anymore. Instead, I now use iCloud Drive for cross-device sync. I use Transmit 5 to get to Dropbox, the few times I need it. It seems weird to do so at first, but it is much lighter on resources, if you don‚Äôt need file sync.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/05/01/201333.html">üìö Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Earlier this year, I completed reading <em><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One">Ready Player One</a></em> by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322">episode of the ‚ÄúTriangulation‚Äù podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir</a>, who enthusiastically recommended the book.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as ‚Äúthe reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games‚Äù. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://qz.com/1264704/at-first-life-without-a-smartphone-was-terrifying-then-it-was-beautiful/">This article on Quartz about limiting smartphone use</a> is both sublime and ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to be present. Is that so much to ask for? Is that so odd to crave in this day and age?</p>

  <p>Maybe you‚Äôre reading this thinking I‚Äôm taking it too far and being ridiculous. That it‚Äôs just a smartphone, people check them all the time and that‚Äôs just the way it is and I should get over it and get used to it. But being on it most of my free time feels wrong on every level. I don‚Äôt want to get used to it anymore. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to reduce the amount of time I spend looking at this damn screen instead of being with my own thoughts. It shouldn‚Äôt be this challenging. But it is. And that says tons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few years ago I wanted to do the same thing this author does‚Äîdowngrade from smartphone to dumbphone‚Äîbut to save money rather than to improve my contact with the outside world. My plan was to replace the smartphone with an iPad Mini, which I would use only on WiFi. Back then I shuttled every article I read from my RSS app (Reeder) to my read-it-later app (Pocket) and cached them offline, so I would rarely be without an offline time waster, to fill in those dull times in waiting rooms or on trains. I didn‚Äôt go through with the plan, though. I got caught up in smartphone fever along with everyone else in my office. It was an exciting time in the development of that technology‚Äîmuch more exciting than today.</p>

<p>I think it is interesting and admirable to try to limit your smartphone use, and it is fun to read about someone‚Äôs experience with it. I <em>also</em> think that this essay is the sort of thing my grandchildren will read in history class, perhaps on the whatever slab of glass and silicon they carry, and laugh at how silly we were to distrust the most transformative technology of our time.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/30/introducing-the-new.html">Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30">The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things‚Äîand to try old things again. In that spirit, we‚Äôre launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It‚Äôll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.</p>

<p>The New Yorker puzzle is a <em>tiny</em> bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I‚Äôm not a strong player), but I‚Äôm happy there‚Äôs another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming my way.</p>

<p>I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply.html">Prolific Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo departs KGI Securities, likely to focus on companies other than Apple</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi/">Kuo‚Äôs departure</a> comes hot off the heels of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/13/apple-memo-on-leaks-leaks/">Apple‚Äôs recent ‚Äúleaked‚Äù memo</a> about leaking that threatened the leaky leaders who leak.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple‚Äôs recent memo and strong stance against leaks ‚Äî supply chain or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn‚Äôt mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors,  they don‚Äôt really benefit Apple fans that much.</p>
