Or you’re sinking like a stone<br />
Carry on<br />
May your past be the sound<br />
Of your feed upon the ground and<br />
Carry on</p>

  <p>‘Cause we are, we are shining stars<br />
We are invincible<br />
We are who we are<br />
On our darkest day<br />
When we’re miles away<br />
So we’ll come, we will find our way home</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/05/18/frozen-the-broadway.html">🎵 Frozen: The Broadway Musical</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Listening to the cast recording of “<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/frozen-broadway-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1378411252">Frozen: The Broadway Musical</a>” for the first time is a bit surreal for me.  Compared to the movie, there are new songs, lyrics changes in existing songs, and, of course, different singers. I don’t think any of the changes are for the better. It’s hard to say for sure, though, because, as a parent of a little girl, I’ve heard the movie and the movie soundtrack about 1,000 times already, and it’s burned into my brain.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/05/17/googles-music-and.html">Google's music and video streaming strategy is a mess</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/17/google-play-youtube-music-premium-strategy/">Engadget has it right</a>. I have no idea what Google audio/video service I should ever consider subscribing to, and because music is tied in there, they don’t offer what I want (ad-free YouTube) at price that is reasonable to me. Maybe it doesn’t matter, because Google will just fold it and create an alternative service, with a different name, price, and product mix, in a couple years anyway.</p>

<p>As much as I rely on Google Search, and as much as I use, indifferently, Gmail, I just don’t understand Google as a company. Their central strategy appears to be “no strategy”. They try stuff out, kill it if it fails, and iterate on what succeeds. This process is fun to watch when the company is a young startup, but is a bit much to bear when they are one of the four pillars of the internet.</p>

<p>If my kids didn’t love YouTube, but hate the ads, I wouldn’t think about subscribing to YouTube Premium (or is it YouTube Red? or is it YouTube Music?) at all. If Google cared about customers like me—very light YouTube viewers who would pay a small amount of money to not be interrupted by ads—I would send them some money each month.</p>

  <p>“Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you”, it added.</p>

  <p>“Scott battled bravely with his own issues for many years and we are immensely proud of him for being so open with his struggles.</p>

  <p>“His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.”</p>

<p>I’m so upset. I <em>love</em> Frightened Rabbit. It was no secret that Scott Hutchison suffered from depression, anxiety, and who knows what else—it’s <em>all over</em> his arch, wry lyrics. Go listen to “<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/keep-yourself-warm/917524230?i=917524306">Keep Yourself Warm</a>” to get an idea of what a great singer/songwriter he was.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it true the site admin can see private bookmarks?</p>

  <p>Yes. I routinely look at raw bookmark data, which includes private bookmarks. Most of the time this means I look at URLs without any identifying context.</p>

  <p>I try to avoid looking at private data on people’s individual pages. However, this is sometimes necessary in order to diagnose and fix bugs in Pinboard, such as search errors, or strange formatting in archived pages.</p>

  <p>I use the metaphor of a hotel manager. I have a key that opens every room, but I try not to use it without a good reason. <strong>And I can assure everyone that five years of running this site has eliminated any trace of curiosity I might have had about what people bookmark.</strong></p>
