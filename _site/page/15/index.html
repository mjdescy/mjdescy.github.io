      <div class="e-content"><p>I just finished setting up my daughter‚Äôs new Chromebook. I bought her an Asus C302C. It‚Äôs a nice machine‚Äî66% of a MacBook Air for 50% of the cost, plus a touchscreen and 180¬∫ hinge for tablet mode.</p>

<p>I was happy to find out that setup was a snap, which I should have expected. Luckily for me, Chrome OS still resembles the windowed version I left behind years ago, so it is familiar enough for me to deal with when I need to.</p>

<p>I did have to figure out how to enable the hilariously named ‚ÄúAustralian scrolling‚Äù feature on the touchpad, though. I guess the name ‚Äúnatural scroll direction‚Äù was taken. As a Mac user, I was surprised that it was not the default. I can‚Äôt even remember what my Windows machines default to, though. Maybe natural scrolling is mainly an Apple thing.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I just ordered a new Chromebook for my daughter, based on Wirecutter‚Äôs recommendation. It was a lot more expensive than I thought Chromebooks sold for, but I bought a decently-speced one for the battery life, screen, and RAM.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure what to expect when I have to set it up. I am not even sure what a Chromebook <em>is</em> anymore, now that ChromeOS runs Android apps. I was an owner/user of the original Cr-48 (the prototype Chromebook from Google). I loved CromeOS when it was just a browser, but Google started to loose me when they adding windowing. Now that the Play Store is available, it just feels like another Windows-type platform. I would prefer the ‚Äújust a browser‚Äù version I had before. Perhaps I will soon learn, once the Chromebook arrives, that it still can be run that way. I have been away from it for too long at this point to know.</p>
