      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/andy-rubin-s-phone-maker-essential-is-said-to-consider-sale">Android Creator Puts Essential Up for Sale, Cancels Next Phone - Bloomberg</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current discussions are focused on a sale of the entire company, including its patent portfolio, hardware products like the original smartphone, an upcoming smart home device and a camera attachment for the phone, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got an Essential Phone in its release date, and was optimistic that the company would succeed. It looks like it hasn’t. Their first phone <em>did</em> have a bad camera experience (hardware and software-wise), which probably prevented any chance of success from the start. The Pixel and the Galaxy phones put it to shame. Plus, it must be next to impossible to make money selling Android phones. It’s not a business I would want to be in.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mean-girls-original-broadway-cast-recording/1372106911">Mean Girls (Original Broadway Cast)</a> is up for the Tony for best musical this year, and I think it has a legitimate shot. While this <em>is</em> a weak year for the American musical, the music of “Mean Girls” is fun and catchy, and the lyrics are funny and full of wordplay. The singing and production of the cast album are top notch, too.</p>

<p>I like it. The high school setting and girl-centric plot, though not the music, remind me a lot of “Bring It On”, which is another musical that has a fantastic cast album and works a lot better than you would think. I don’t know if this show will be a hit on Broadway, but I predict a long life on high school drama club stages in the future.</p>

Of your feed upon the ground and<br />
Carry on</p>

  <p>‘Cause we are, we are shining stars<br />
We are invincible<br />
We are who we are<br />
On our darkest day<br />
When we’re miles away<br />
So we’ll come, we will find our way home</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/05/18/frozen-the-broadway.html">🎵 Frozen: The Broadway Musical</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Listening to the cast recording of “<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/frozen-broadway-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1378411252">Frozen: The Broadway Musical</a>” for the first time is a bit surreal for me.  Compared to the movie, there are new songs, lyrics changes in existing songs, and, of course, different singers. I don’t think any of the changes are for the better. It’s hard to say for sure, though, because, as a parent of a little girl, I’ve heard the movie and the movie soundtrack about 1,000 times already, and it’s burned into my brain.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/17/google-play-youtube-music-premium-strategy/">Engadget has it right</a>. I have no idea what Google audio/video service I should ever consider subscribing to, and because music is tied in there, they don’t offer what I want (ad-free YouTube) at price that is reasonable to me. Maybe it doesn’t matter, because Google will just fold it and create an alternative service, with a different name, price, and product mix, in a couple years anyway.</p>

<p>As much as I rely on Google Search, and as much as I use, indifferently, Gmail, I just don’t understand Google as a company. Their central strategy appears to be “no strategy”. They try stuff out, kill it if it fails, and iterate on what succeeds. This process is fun to watch when the company is a young startup, but is a bit much to bear when they are one of the four pillars of the internet.</p>

<p>If my kids didn’t love YouTube, but hate the ads, I wouldn’t think about subscribing to YouTube Premium (or is it YouTube Red? or is it YouTube Music?) at all. If Google cared about customers like me—very light YouTube viewers who would pay a small amount of money to not be interrupted by ads—I would send them some money each month.</p>
