		<h1><a href="/2018/05/04/groundhog-day-the.html">üéµ Groundhog Day the Musical</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/groundhog-day-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1215389487">Groundhog Day</a></em> is my second favorite Broadway musical of last year (closely behind ‚ÄúDear Evan Hansen‚Äù, which has more plot-related problems but really terrific music), and the only one I saw. I revisit the cast album from time to time, because it is terrific, and multiple listens reveal hidden depth in the earthy lyrics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-CD-Review-GROUNDHOG-DAY-THE-MUSICAL-Original-Broadway-Cast-Recording-is-Charmingly-Animated-20170516">Broadway World‚Äôs review of the cast album</a> is remarkably spot on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On first listen, Minchin‚Äôs melodies are captivating. They are undeniably more poppy than his dark, moody, and undulating score for MATILDA; however, it‚Äôs obvious that he has written each of these compositions with the same consideration and care that he did with MATILDA. Despite the more simplistic sounding and pop aural soundscape, the melodies are intricately layered showing an artistry and skill that is not apparent in one listening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope Tim Minchin keeps writing musicals. His music and lyrics for his prior show, <em>Matilda</em>, are a masterpiece. (Listen to the London cast recording over the Broadway one if you can; it is a <em>far</em> better performance, though it is missing some of Matilda‚Äôs monologues.) ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite rank as a masterpiece in my book, but it is really, really good.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I am <em>so</em> accustomed to listening to Podcasts with <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>‚Äôs ‚ÄúVoice Boost‚Äù feature that, when I turn it off (as I‚Äôm doing today, because my Bluetooth headphones are too loud) my podcasts sound flat and lifeless.</p>

<p>I wonder, though, why more podcast producers don‚Äôt run their episodes through dynamic compression and EQ filters (‚ÄúVoice Boost‚Äù) prior to publishing. For that matter, why don‚Äôt they ‚Äúshorten silences‚Äù on their end, too? That way, everyone could benefit from better audio quality and a shorter runtime. I suspect that some of big, radio-show-based podcasts do, but it‚Äôs obvious that most other podcasts don‚Äôt.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>The annual <a href="https://panic.com/blog/the-2017-panic-report/">Panic Report</a> is always worth a read. I use a lot of their apps, and have long considered them an app studio so talented that I will buy whatever they make, so long as I can sometimes use it. They are refreshingly open and honest about their business, too. Their annual reports are especially eye opening if you are a developer and are curious about the business aspects of the App Store.</p>

<p>I thought this part, toward the end, was kind of funny.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ë® I‚Äôm using Transmit 5 as my primary interface to Dropbox. Am I a bad person? ‚ÄîKyle</p>

  <p>Absolutely not. This is so potentially powerful, we even made a video about it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don‚Äôt install Dropbox on my Mac anymore. Instead, I now use iCloud Drive for cross-device sync. I use Transmit 5 to get to Dropbox, the few times I need it. It seems weird to do so at first, but it is much lighter on resources, if you don‚Äôt need file sync.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/05/01/201333.html">üìö Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Earlier this year, I completed reading <em><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One">Ready Player One</a></em> by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322">episode of the ‚ÄúTriangulation‚Äù podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir</a>, who enthusiastically recommended the book.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as ‚Äúthe reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games‚Äù. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/05/01/i-quit-my.html">I quit my iPhone for a basic Nokia and it was hard but worth it</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://qz.com/1264704/at-first-life-without-a-smartphone-was-terrifying-then-it-was-beautiful/">This article on Quartz about limiting smartphone use</a> is both sublime and ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to be present. Is that so much to ask for? Is that so odd to crave in this day and age?</p>

  <p>Maybe you‚Äôre reading this thinking I‚Äôm taking it too far and being ridiculous. That it‚Äôs just a smartphone, people check them all the time and that‚Äôs just the way it is and I should get over it and get used to it. But being on it most of my free time feels wrong on every level. I don‚Äôt want to get used to it anymore. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to reduce the amount of time I spend looking at this damn screen instead of being with my own thoughts. It shouldn‚Äôt be this challenging. But it is. And that says tons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few years ago I wanted to do the same thing this author does‚Äîdowngrade from smartphone to dumbphone‚Äîbut to save money rather than to improve my contact with the outside world. My plan was to replace the smartphone with an iPad Mini, which I would use only on WiFi. Back then I shuttled every article I read from my RSS app (Reeder) to my read-it-later app (Pocket) and cached them offline, so I would rarely be without an offline time waster, to fill in those dull times in waiting rooms or on trains. I didn‚Äôt go through with the plan, though. I got caught up in smartphone fever along with everyone else in my office. It was an exciting time in the development of that technology‚Äîmuch more exciting than today.</p>

<p>I think it is interesting and admirable to try to limit your smartphone use, and it is fun to read about someone‚Äôs experience with it. I <em>also</em> think that this essay is the sort of thing my grandchildren will read in history class, perhaps on the whatever slab of glass and silicon they carry, and laugh at how silly we were to distrust the most transformative technology of our time.</p>

<p>I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.</p>

<p>The New Yorker puzzle is a <em>tiny</em> bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I‚Äôm not a strong player), but I‚Äôm happy there‚Äôs another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming my way.</p>

<p>I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.</p>

  <p>Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on?

</blockquote>

<p>I wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn‚Äôt mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors,  they don‚Äôt really benefit Apple fans that much.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Om Malik wrote <a href="https://om.co/2018/04/29/shinolas-canfield-headphones/">a thoughtful review</a> of a rather high end headphone, the Shinola Canfield. He includes his philosophy on what makes good headphones, and states that you can find really good headphones between $200 and $500, which I wholeheartedly agree with. I especially enjoyed learning about which headphones he keeps around:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>At home, I listen to Focal Clear, probably the best and the most expensive headphones I will ever owned. I have no desire to either upgrade or change these phones. [‚Ä¶]</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For conference calls and phone conversations, I use Apple AirPods. They aren‚Äôt my choice for music, but for watching videos on my iPad, they are more than adequate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For long-haul flights, I have a pair of beat-up Bose headphones that take AA batteries and are as low-tech as Bose can get. They sit in my luggage and will be there until Bose stops making the replacement ear pads. They are not great for music, but on a loud aircraft, they are just a way to mute everything.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I love knowing that he and I have a similar lineup of headphones, and we split our time between them similarly: a top end headphone (except my top end are the Oppo PM-3, which cost a <em>lot</em> less than his Focal Clear); Apple AirPods for phone calls (I use them for calls, podcasts, and TV but almost never for music); and super old, now-crummy Bose for use on airplanes only.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681">our current, worsening outbreak</a> is the <em>second</em> E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country‚Äôs will to improve it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.</p>

  <p>More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.</p>

  <p>People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it‚Äôs worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.</p>

<p>Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have <em>never</em> gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.</p>

<p>I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.</p>
