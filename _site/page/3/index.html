		<h1><a href="/2018/04/23/airpods-batteries-drain.html">AirPods batteries drain much faster on phone calls</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I thought my AirPods batteries were already aging out of their useful life span, due to quick draining on numerous hour long phone calls today and last week. It turns out, talk time is only “up to 2 hours”, while listening time (my main use case) is 2 1/2 times that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mmef2am/a/airpods">Per Apple</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AirPods (single charge): Up to 5 hours listening time,(2) Up to 2 hours talk time(5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So…phew! I’m more worried about having to replace them after less than two years due to a battery issue than about shorter battery life on calls.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I am enjoying using <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac/">Tower</a> over Atlassian SourceTree. <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">SourceTree</a> has many, many features, and is free to use, but it has some puzzling bugs that never seem to get fixed. For example, it never deletes branches via Git Flow, no matter how many times I try to reconfigure it.</p>

<p>Tower is faster, works better, and has a clean UI that fits in on the Mac very well. When I emailed Tower support about something, they responded almost instantly. That sold it for me. When the Tower 3 beta expires, I will be purchasing a license.</p>
