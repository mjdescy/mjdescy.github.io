      <div class="e-content"><p>I am unreasonably excited <a href="https://kottke.org/18/03/max-richters-sleep-an-8-hour-album-designed-to-be-listened-to-while-you-sleep">to learn about</a> Max Richter’s 8 1/2 hour album “<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sleep/1358135251">Sleep</a>”. It is meant to be played all night long, as you sleep. What I have heard so far is quiet, relaxing, and beautiful. I doubt my wife would let us play it through the night while we sleep. But maybe we could play it instead of white noise for our kids.</p>

But now I get it in a way I hadn’t. Some things I thought were annoying, like Po’s actions, were <em>supposed</em> to be. The whole movie is about learning from failure, and is well structured around that theme.</p>

I’ve lived too long without it to feel like it is necessary now. The Nest has not noticeably improved since I got it. The best thing I did with it is set it up with Homebridge to use with Siri. It works faster and more reliably through that hack than through the official iOS and watchOS apps. I wish Nest, the company, had done better with it, but they seem to have lost interest in their initial product years ago.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/03/14/justice-league.html">📽️ Justice League</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>📽️ I saw “<a href="http://www.justiceleaguethemovie.com">Justice League</a>” last night and really enjoyed it. I had very low expectations, due to its grim, overly macho <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-DM9uBtVI">preview</a> and <a href="http://batmanvsuperman.dccomics.com">predecessor</a>. I’m a comic book fan, though, and “Justice League” felt like the sort of story i’ve seen many times before, but, of course, filmed in live action with tons of special effects. I thought that the film <em>did</em> have problems, but it was obviously made for comic book fans—who have read and seen the save-the-world story many times before, and want to see an even bigger version of it—and it succeeded more than all the negative reviews suggested. Yes, I could quibble about a dozen things, and I think the movie would have been even better with just Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman in it, but I enjoyed it quite a bit, and hope they make a sequel in a couple years.</p>
