      <div class="e-content"><p>I recently finished reading Steen Johnson’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html">How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World</a>. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson’s writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.</p>

<p>As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it’s a wonderful read to anyone who loves the “history of ideas course” way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments—“hummingbird effects” and “the adjacent possible”—that I particularly like.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/27/finland-has-second.html">Finland Has Second Thoughts About Giving Free Money to Jobless People</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://nyti.ms/2HpHmQE">Finland is letting its yearlong experiment with Universal Basic Income expire</a>. It turns out giving out tax money to people with no strings attached isn’t widely popular. What is interesting to me, a US citizen, is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant.</p>

  <p>Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth.</p>

  <p>“In a sense,” said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, “Finland already has basic income.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I support Universal Basic Income. I think it would help the poor and would spur more people, like me, to start their own businesses. Of course, if we in the US had government provided healthcare, education, and job training programs, it might be enough to spur new business creation. I have the talent to start a consultancy, but the responsibility to pay for healthcare and my children’s education has always made me feel more secure with a normal, salaried position.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/26/mac-apps-are.html">Mac apps are harder than iOS apps</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I agree with Matt Ronge’s article “<a href="https://medium.com/astro-hq/mac-apps-are-harder-than-ios-apps-614338e2e470">Mac apps are harder than iOS apps</a>”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was surprised when a recent project brought me back to the Mac and I discovered how finicky Cocoa really is. I was particularly shocked because I always remembered Cocoa as a particularly nice set of APIs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, a <em>big</em> problem that Mr. Ronge does not mention is that there is very little information available online to help a macOS developer work through anything but the most basic situations. Sure, you can find some tutorials on <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/macos">raywenderlich.com</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDg-YmnNehm3KB0BpytkUJg">YouTube</a>, but once you go beyond the basics, good information is hard to find.</p>

<p>If you search for “How do I do X? on iOS” you will likely find dozens or hundreds of hits, including numerous tutorials, open source libraries, and Stack Overflow questions. Conversely, you will be lucky to find one or two resources for the query “How do I do X? on macOS” (or OS X).</p>

<p>It is understandable, because iOS is such a huge platform, but it is also quite frustrating, at least to a solo developer like me. If Apple creates <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps">a new framework</a> or shim layer to let us use iOS frameworks on macOS, I think it would make making Mac apps a lot easier for predominantly iOS-oriented developers like me..</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/26/blocker-x.html">1Blocker X</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I picked up <a href="https://1blocker.com/">1Blocker X</a> based on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/1blocker-x-for-ios-review/">this review from John Voorhies on MacStores</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first thing you will notice when you set up 1Blocker X on an iOS device is its 7 toggles in Safari’s Content Blocker section of the Settings app. It’s a bit of a head-scratcher at first until you realize that this is what allows 1Blocker X to expand beyond the confines of its predecessor.</p>

  <p>You see, iOS limits the number of blocking rules that can be implemented by an app to 50,000. That’s a lot of rules, but sadly not enough given the amount of junk on the Internet these days. As a result, it’s a limit that 1Blocker began to run into not long after it launched in 2015.</p>

  <p>Finding a way around that hard limit required a rewrite of 1Blocker from the ground up. The result is 1Blocker X, an app with around three times as many blocking rules, room to grow, and enhanced flexibility for applying those rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think I really needed to replace the content blocker I had been using, but it hadn’t been updated in a really long time, so I’m not sure it’s blocking rules are up-to-date.</p>

<p>Much of the work these things do is invisilble. It’s easy to see if ads are blocked, of course, but not so with trackers and malware, which I care more about. At home I <em>also</em> block ads at the DNS level using <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>, running on an old Raspberry Pi. I heartily recommend setting up a Pi-hole (it’s easy; there are tutorials to follow). I miss having it when I’m out of the house, which is why a content blocker is helpful, too.</p>

<p>So far, 1Blocker X has been working just fine. I’ve noticed no decrease in speed from Safari, despite the crazy amount of blocking rules I have enabled.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I thought my AirPods batteries were already aging out of their useful life span, due to quick draining on numerous hour long phone calls today and last week. It turns out, talk time is only “up to 2 hours”, while listening time (my main use case) is 2 1/2 times that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mmef2am/a/airpods">Per Apple</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AirPods (single charge): Up to 5 hours listening time,(2) Up to 2 hours talk time(5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So…phew! I’m more worried about having to replace them after less than two years due to a battery issue than about shorter battery life on calls.</p>

<p>Tower is faster, works better, and has a clean UI that fits in on the Mac very well. When I emailed Tower support about something, they responded almost instantly. That sold it for me. When the Tower 3 beta expires, I will be purchasing a license.</p>
