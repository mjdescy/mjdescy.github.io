<blockquote>
  <p>For years, conservatives complained about activist liberal judges making it up as they went along. Today, they are the activists. Under the guise of “originalism,” they are rewriting the nation’s laws to further the reactionary political agenda of the Republican Party and its biggest donors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the scare quotes around “originalism”. It, like all the other -ism words we throw around—conservatism, liberalism, socialism—
is completely devoid of meaning.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/06/26/tower-s-release.html">Tower 3.0's release and new pricing model</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I have been beta testing <a href="https://www.git-tower.com">Tower 3.0</a>, which is a very nice Git GUI client, for the past few months. The team behind it have just announced that the version 3.0 is complete. I was ready last week to purchase the software at its old price, which would be a one-time purchase of $79, but Tower has also announced that it is moving to <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/pricing">subscription pricing</a> for version 3.</p>

<p>Switching from paid-up-front to subscription-based is somewhat controversial. I, for one, am all for software subscriptions, so I support the developers’ decision. However, their decision has signaled that Tower is not for me. Even with the generous 50% discount for the first year that they have offered me, as a beta tester, the developers have priced me out of their product. For a professional, making a living from their software,  the subscription cost for an important workplace tool is merely a drop in the bucket. But for me, a hobbyist developer who charges for my apps to cover my costs, I don’t make nearly enough money from my apps to justify paying more than a couple dollars per month for a Git client.</p>

<p>Git’s command line tools and <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">Atlassian’s SourceTree</a> client are free to use. I will be back to using SourceTree—which which is free, full-featured, but not as well polished as Tower—shortly. Thanks to the Tower team for allowing me to beta test their software. I wish them the best of luck.</p>
