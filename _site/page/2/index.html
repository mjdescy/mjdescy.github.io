<blockquote>
  <p>For years, conservatives complained about activist liberal judges making it up as they went along. Today, they are the activists. Under the guise of “originalism,” they are rewriting the nation’s laws to further the reactionary political agenda of the Republican Party and its biggest donors.</p>

<p>Note the scare quotes around “originalism”. It, like all the other -ism words we throw around—conservatism, liberalism, socialism—
is completely devoid of meaning.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/06/26/tower-s-release.html">Tower 3.0's release and new pricing model</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I have been beta testing <a href="https://www.git-tower.com">Tower 3.0</a>, which is a very nice Git GUI client, for the past few months. The team behind it have just announced that the version 3.0 is complete. I was ready last week to purchase the software at its old price, which would be a one-time purchase of $79, but Tower has also announced that it is moving to <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/pricing">subscription pricing</a> for version 3.</p>

<p>Switching from paid-up-front to subscription-based is somewhat controversial. I, for one, am all for software subscriptions, so I support the developers’ decision. However, their decision has signaled that Tower is not for me. Even with the generous 50% discount for the first year that they have offered me, as a beta tester, the developers have priced me out of their product. For a professional, making a living from their software,  the subscription cost for an important workplace tool is merely a drop in the bucket. But for me, a hobbyist developer who charges for my apps to cover my costs, I don’t make nearly enough money from my apps to justify paying more than a couple dollars per month for a Git client.</p>

<p>Git’s command line tools and <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">Atlassian’s SourceTree</a> client are free to use. I will be back to using SourceTree—which which is free, full-featured, but not as well polished as Tower—shortly. Thanks to the Tower team for allowing me to beta test their software. I wish them the best of luck.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/business/dealbook/general-electric-dow-jones.html">It’s the end of an era.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, don’t even get me started as to the idiocy of following a price-weighted stock index in the age of computers, but being part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average">DJIA</a> is a huge badge of honor that G.E. has now lost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company’s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company’s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent decline of G.E. has been shocking to me. When I was at business school in Connecticut, G.E. was, rightly, considered a giant of industry and of financial services. Now it appears to be a lumbering giant, a lion in winter. I wonder what it will take to turn the company around.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/06/19/apple-didnt-kill.html">Apple Didn't Kill Appkit...</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>This <a href="http://subfurther.com/blog/2018/06/17/apple-didnt-kill-appkit-millenials-did/">article</a>, quite rightly, made me feel bad about not pushing through the troubles I had porting SwiftoDo to the Mac—a project I haven’t touched in over a year now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it really that hard to share a codebase between Mac and iOS? I just sent off the “other platforms” chapter of Xcode Treasures, and one of the sections is about creating multi-platform projects. The book shows how to add tvOS to an iOS project from earlier in the book, but the idea is the same regardless of which platforms you support: portion off the code you can into cross-platform frameworks, ideally leaving only platform-specific UI code in each platform’s targets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I modularized a lot of my code to allow it to happen someday, but found out that it would require a lot of work to ramp up my AppKit skills. All the data manipulation code is in a well-contained library. That’s just a small part of the app, though. The features are all in UI code, and porting it to AppKit resembles a 90% rewrite of my app.</p>

<p>If I was doing development professionally, I would have done it. But as a hobbyist, it’s hard to want to dive deep into AppKit when there are a million things to create or fix on iOS, which feels like Apple’s future platform anyway. Maybe I’m lazy, and maybe Apple is going to help me out with UIKit on the Mac twelve months from now.</p>
