      <div class="e-content"><p>I found out that Toad the Wet Sproket re-recorded their greatest hits from the 1990s. <a href="https://toadthewetsprocket.bandcamp.com/album/all-you-want">All You Want</a> was released in 2011. It‚Äôs unusual for a band to re-record songs <em>in the studio</em> (live albums are another thing entirely). I found it enjoyable to listen to, though I‚Äôm not sure why they did it. The production is more modern‚Äîread, a lot louder, but with a larger soundstage‚Äîbut the songs aren‚Äôt re-interpreted or anything.</p>

<p>Texas did this, too, with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_25">Texas 25</a>, which marked their 25th anniversary as a band. Texas reinterpreted some of their songs, though. That album sounds great and is worth a listen.</p>

But learning how a CEO manages his time is not that valuable for any non-CEO to learn about, simply because a CEO doesn‚Äôt have a boss whose demands and whims make time management impossible sometimes. What makes time management difficult‚Äîand stressful‚Äîis not just whatever the workload is: it is <em>lack of control</em> over your schedule, location, and what you are doing. I‚Äôd rather hear about people 1-3 levels down from the CEO about how they manage their time. Their stories would be more relatable, though they would sell fewer papers.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Today felt like a good day to listen to a long vocal jazz playlist through my V Moda Crossfade Wireless 2. Their warm, somewhat bass-y sound signature works surprisingly well for that genre. I mostly think of them as great for rock and pop music, but they handled sparse arrangements of vocals (male and female), piano, bass, and drums (mostly brushwork) surprisingly well.</p>

<p>I had to use wired mode because the Bluetooth connection is too loud for me, even at the lowest volume setting, on my iOS devices. The Bluetooth volume level appears to be more sane when I use them with my Apple TV or Mac.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>While I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems. My goal was to trace my journey from a normal person to an audiophile, as I upgrade my gear up over the years.</p>

<p>The speakers that I have had are nothing special, but they are special, in a way, to me, because of all the music I listened to through them.</p>

<p>I plan to write another, hopefully more interesting, series about my various headphones in the near future.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>What <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-history-of-aperture/">Stephen Hackett‚Äôs piece</a> says about Apple‚Äôs Aperture‚Äîmainly about its shortcomings‚Äîmay be true, it does not reflect that, from a UI standpoint, Aperture was a masterpiece. From not locking you into specific modes or workflows, to having sensible single-key keyboard shortcuts for nearly every command, it was an absolute joy to use. I used it for almost its entire product lifespan.</p>

<p>When Apple announced its end of life, I tried to move to Adobe Lightroom, and just hated it. I stuck with Aperture until over a year into the life of Apple‚Äôs current Photos app. I still miss Aperture‚Äôs editing tools, and would really be sore about it if my digital cameras today were as bad as the ones I had back in 2005-2011.</p>

<p>Apple Photos is a decent replacement now that it has gone through several iterations. I <em>really</em> wish it had retouching support on the iPad, though. (It is current Mac-only.)</p>
