  <p>“Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you”, it added.</p>

  <p>“Scott battled bravely with his own issues for many years and we are immensely proud of him for being so open with his struggles.</p>

  <p>“His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m so upset. I <em>love</em> Frightened Rabbit. It was no secret that Scott Hutchison suffered from depression, anxiety, and who knows what else—it’s <em>all over</em> his arch, wry lyrics. Go listen to “<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/keep-yourself-warm/917524230?i=917524306">Keep Yourself Warm</a>” to get an idea of what a great singer/songwriter he was.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I came across this tonight, as I was perusing <a href="https://pinboard.in/faq/#cjk_search">Pinboard’s FAQ</a>, trying to learn something different about the service that I have been ignoring for the past year or so.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it true the site admin can see private bookmarks?</p>

  <p>Yes. I routinely look at raw bookmark data, which includes private bookmarks. Most of the time this means I look at URLs without any identifying context.</p>

  <p>I try to avoid looking at private data on people’s individual pages. However, this is sometimes necessary in order to diagnose and fix bugs in Pinboard, such as search errors, or strange formatting in archived pages.</p>

  <p>I use the metaphor of a hotel manager. I have a key that opens every room, but I try not to use it without a good reason. <strong>And I can assure everyone that five years of running this site has eliminated any trace of curiosity I might have had about what people bookmark.</strong></p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/05/09/the-best-trackballs.html">The Best Trackballs according to Wirecutter</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Wirecutter updated its <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-trackballs/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=RSS%20Feed">trackballs review</a> today. Their recommendations are basically unchanged, which is no surprise, because the entire trackball market has been stagnant for years.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of evolution in trackballs, I am a huge fan of them. I credit swapping my mouse for a trackball with reducing, to almost nothing, repetitive stress injuries from computing. I find trackballs to be more comfortable to use and more precise than both mice and trackpads. I actually have one for each my my machines (Mac and PC), and bring the smaller one with me when I travel for work.</p>

<p>I can’t quibble with WireCutter’s top pick, but I disagree with their assessment of my main trackball, the <a href="https://www.kensington.com/en/ae/4493/k72327eu/slimblade-trackball">Kensington SlimBlade</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of using a hardware scroll ring as on the Kensington Expert Mouse and Orbit with Scroll Ring, with the Kensington SlimBlade Trackball you have to rotate the ball to scroll, which is tough to do without bouncing the cursor around the screen. The SlimBlade’s buttons feel hollow compared with the Expert Mouse’s, and its shiny plastic and metal surfaces attract fingerprints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, its buttons could be a little clickier, but rotating the ball to scroll without moving the cursor is actually pretty easy. Unlike the Expert Mouse, the SlimBlade doesn’t have an unnecessarily steep angle to it, so you can use it comfortably without a wrist rest. And, honestly, saying its “surfaces attract fingerprints” is just plain stupid. My iPad Pro screen, which is the finest screen in my entire house, “attracts fingerprints” too. I think product reviewers need to strike that quibble off their list.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/05/08/okkervil-rivers-back.html">🎵 Okkervil River's back catalog</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Listening to Okkervil River’s new album, <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-the-rainbow-rain/1342462882">In the Rainbow Rain</a></em>, today gave me an excuse to dive, once again, into their back catalog. I am a huge fan of the band’s 2005-2008 work, a trifecta of literate rock albums: <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/black-sheep-boy-10th-anniversary-edition/1036936862">Black Sheep Boy</a></em>, <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stand-ins/543561172">The Stand Ins</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stage-names-bonus-track-version/453256340">The Stage Names</a></em>. Each of these albums is a staggering artistic achievement; each song on them is an evocative short story with enough weight, depth, and maturity to reward repeated listenings.</p>

<p>I haven’t spent nearly as many hours listening to their work since then, which which includes <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-silver-gymnasium/977288852">The Silver Gymnasium</a></em> and <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/away/1113050258">Away</a></em>. This, more recent, period is characterized by a darker, more somber tone. It’s easy to imagine the band’s frontman, and only consistent member now, Will Sheff, slowing down, looking back on life, and looking far forward to his eventual death. That’s way heavier stuff than what I normally listen to, but not <em>too</em> heavy to be enjoyable.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/05/08/trying-to-get.html">Trying to get back into Pinboard, or, maybe I am over-complicating things</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I am trying to get back into <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, the reliable and, a few years ago, faddish, “antisocial” bookmarking service.</p>

<p>I had been using it as an archive of my old browser bookmarks, and as a “read it later” service to push articles to from Twitter and my RSS reader. I used to use it pretty consistently, with the help of an iOS app and a Chrome plugin for my Mac. When I went on an RSS and Twitter diet late last year, though, I kicked my Pinboard app off my phone as well. More recently, I wiped my Mac clean and reinstalled a bare minimum of apps and services, which did not include Chrome or the whatever Pinboard plugin I had been using with Safari. Since then, Safari and Google have been my bookmarking service, in that I don’t actually save any bookmarks, but rely on typing URLs or searches directly into the browser address bar most of the time.</p>

<p>Recently, in part because iOS supports it in the long-press menu on every URL, I have been saving links to Apple’s built-in Safari Reading List. Saving bookmarks is as low-friction as can be, but reading them is, paradoxically, very high friction for me. I never think to dig into the second panel within Safari’s bookmarks to look for something to read. Consequently, my Safari Reading List has become a graveyard for links that I (think I) want to read but probably never will. Maybe that’s what is is actually for, and maybe that’s what I actually need.</p>

<p>For fun, though, I’m going to try to use Pinboard more instead.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://nyti.ms/2q5d7oj">This article</a> inspired me to install <a href="https://gethiya.app.link/phone-guard">Hiya</a> on my iPhone to block spam calls. I will find out eventually how well it works. I get 5-10 robocalls per week, mostly from the same exchange as my mobile number or my Google Voice number.</p>

<p>It seems to rely on a central service for all blocking rules, including an optional whitelist for your contacts and an optional rule based on your phone number for “neighbor” spam. It can identify and block a gigantic list of known spammers and robocallers, which is beyond what I need.</p>

<p>Having looked at it, and its competition, it seems like there isn’t a good on-device-only call blocker for the super-privacy conscious who, like me, only want to whitelist contacts and blacklist all other numbers in a couple of area codes and exchanges. I really want to write one. It would have to be free, I think, based on the free competition out there—but it may fit a particular niche that is out there.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I haven’t thought about this in a long time, but I am actually surprised that <a href="https://plus.google.com">Google Plus</a> still exists. Considering how many products Google launches and kills each year for practically no reason, it’s astounding that one of its monumental flops has been allowed to limp along for so many years. I think it must still be around because either it still generates signals for Google (how many though, compared to other things?), or because it was tied in, at a technical level, to more valuable and integral services like Gmail. All I know is that its continued presence in the Google portfolio serves as yet another reminder to me about how unfocused Google is as an organization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Micro.blog posts: 300</li>
  <li>Days on the platform: 136 (joined 2017-12-19)</li>
  <li>Average posts per day: 2.2</li>
  <li>How many people I follow: 131</li>
  <li>How many people follow me: I have no idea, and that is fine</li>
  <li>How much engagement I get from other users: a pleasingly good amount</li>
  <li>How much I happily paid Manton for Micro.blog hosting thus far: $30 USD ($5/month, not including the free trial period)</li>
  <li>How little I could have paid, if I wanted: $0 for a WordPress.com blog or $1/month for an inexpensive WordPress host, plus the free Micro.blog account</li>
</ul>

<p>Micro.blog has gotten me into blogging again after a long time away from it. I enjoy owning my own content, the focus on <em>writing</em> rather than liking or retweeting, and, most of all, the lack of <em>friction</em> in the platform.  Posting short or long form content is as simple as can be, and I don’t have a WordPress install and/or server to maintain.</p>

<p>I am having fun on the platform and look forward to continuing to do so.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On first listen, Minchin’s melodies are captivating. They are undeniably more poppy than his dark, moody, and undulating score for MATILDA; however, it’s obvious that he has written each of these compositions with the same consideration and care that he did with MATILDA. Despite the more simplistic sounding and pop aural soundscape, the melodies are intricately layered showing an artistry and skill that is not apparent in one listening.</p>

<p>I hope Tim Minchin keeps writing musicals. His music and lyrics for his prior show, <em>Matilda</em>, are a masterpiece. (Listen to the London cast recording over the Broadway one if you can; it is a <em>far</em> better performance, though it is missing some of Matilda’s monologues.) “Groundhog Day” doesn’t quite rank as a masterpiece in my book, but it is really, really good.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I am <em>so</em> accustomed to listening to Podcasts with <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>’s “Voice Boost” feature that, when I turn it off (as I’m doing today, because my Bluetooth headphones are too loud) my podcasts sound flat and lifeless.</p>

<p>I wonder, though, why more podcast producers don’t run their episodes through dynamic compression and EQ filters (“Voice Boost”) prior to publishing. For that matter, why don’t they “shorten silences” on their end, too? That way, everyone could benefit from better audio quality and a shorter runtime. I suspect that some of big, radio-show-based podcasts do, but it’s obvious that most other podcasts don’t.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>The annual <a href="https://panic.com/blog/the-2017-panic-report/">Panic Report</a> is always worth a read. I use a lot of their apps, and have long considered them an app studio so talented that I will buy whatever they make, so long as I can sometimes use it. They are refreshingly open and honest about their business, too. Their annual reports are especially eye opening if you are a developer and are curious about the business aspects of the App Store.</p>

<p>I thought this part, toward the end, was kind of funny.</p>

  <p>Absolutely not. This is so potentially powerful, we even made a video about it!</p>

<p>I don’t install Dropbox on my Mac anymore. Instead, I now use iCloud Drive for cross-device sync. I use Transmit 5 to get to Dropbox, the few times I need it. It seems weird to do so at first, but it is much lighter on resources, if you don’t need file sync.</p>

<p>Remind me again why you decided to rewrite, yet again, the Dropbox-related code in your app? You know, the code that you may just get rid of completely a few months from now?</p>
