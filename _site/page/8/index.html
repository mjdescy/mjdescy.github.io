      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://qz.com/1264704/at-first-life-without-a-smartphone-was-terrifying-then-it-was-beautiful/">This article on Quartz about limiting smartphone use</a> is both sublime and ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to be present. Is that so much to ask for? Is that so odd to crave in this day and age?</p>

  <p>Maybe you’re reading this thinking I’m taking it too far and being ridiculous. That it’s just a smartphone, people check them all the time and that’s just the way it is and I should get over it and get used to it. But being on it most of my free time feels wrong on every level. I don’t want to get used to it anymore. It shouldn’t be this hard to reduce the amount of time I spend looking at this damn screen instead of being with my own thoughts. It shouldn’t be this challenging. But it is. And that says tons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few years ago I wanted to do the same thing this author does—downgrade from smartphone to dumbphone—but to save money rather than to improve my contact with the outside world. My plan was to replace the smartphone with an iPad Mini, which I would use only on WiFi. Back then I shuttled every article I read from my RSS app (Reeder) to my read-it-later app (Pocket) and cached them offline, so I would rarely be without an offline time waster, to fill in those dull times in waiting rooms or on trains. I didn’t go through with the plan, though. I got caught up in smartphone fever along with everyone else in my office. It was an exciting time in the development of that technology—much more exciting than today.</p>

<p>I think it is interesting and admirable to try to limit your smartphone use, and it is fun to read about someone’s experience with it. I <em>also</em> think that this essay is the sort of thing my grandchildren will read in history class, perhaps on the whatever slab of glass and silicon they carry, and laugh at how silly we were to distrust the most transformative technology of our time.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30">The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things—and to try old things again. In that spirit, we’re launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It’ll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.</p>

<p>The New Yorker puzzle is a <em>tiny</em> bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I’m not a strong player), but I’m happy there’s another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming my way.</p>

<p>I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple’s recent memo and strong stance against leaks — supply chain or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn’t mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors,  they don’t really benefit Apple fans that much.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/29/om-maliks-shinola.html">Om Malik's Shinola Canfield headphone review</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Om Malik wrote <a href="https://om.co/2018/04/29/shinolas-canfield-headphones/">a thoughtful review</a> of a rather high end headphone, the Shinola Canfield. He includes his philosophy on what makes good headphones, and states that you can find really good headphones between $200 and $500, which I wholeheartedly agree with. I especially enjoyed learning about which headphones he keeps around:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>At home, I listen to Focal Clear, probably the best and the most expensive headphones I will ever owned. I have no desire to either upgrade or change these phones. […]</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For conference calls and phone conversations, I use Apple AirPods. They aren’t my choice for music, but for watching videos on my iPad, they are more than adequate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For long-haul flights, I have a pair of beat-up Bose headphones that take AA batteries and are as low-tech as Bose can get. They sit in my luggage and will be there until Bose stops making the replacement ear pads. They are not great for music, but on a loud aircraft, they are just a way to mute everything.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I love knowing that he and I have a similar lineup of headphones, and we split our time between them similarly: a top end headphone (except my top end are the Oppo PM-3, which cost a <em>lot</em> less than his Focal Clear); Apple AirPods for phone calls (I use them for calls, podcasts, and TV but almost never for music); and super old, now-crummy Bose for use on airplanes only.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/04/27/i-miss-caesar.html">I miss Caesar salad</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681">our current, worsening outbreak</a> is the <em>second</em> E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country’s will to improve it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.</p>

  <p>More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.</p>

  <p>People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it’s worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.</p>

<p>Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have <em>never</em> gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.</p>

<p>I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I recently finished reading Steen Johnson’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html">How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World</a>. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson’s writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.</p>

<p>As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it’s a wonderful read to anyone who loves the “history of ideas course” way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments—“hummingbird effects” and “the adjacent possible”—that I particularly like.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://nyti.ms/2HpHmQE">Finland is letting its yearlong experiment with Universal Basic Income expire</a>. It turns out giving out tax money to people with no strings attached isn’t widely popular. What is interesting to me, a US citizen, is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant.</p>

  <p>Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth.</p>

  <p>“In a sense,” said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, “Finland already has basic income.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I support Universal Basic Income. I think it would help the poor and would spur more people, like me, to start their own businesses. Of course, if we in the US had government provided healthcare, education, and job training programs, it might be enough to spur new business creation. I have the talent to start a consultancy, but the responsibility to pay for healthcare and my children’s education has always made me feel more secure with a normal, salaried position.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I agree with Matt Ronge’s article “<a href="https://medium.com/astro-hq/mac-apps-are-harder-than-ios-apps-614338e2e470">Mac apps are harder than iOS apps</a>”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was surprised when a recent project brought me back to the Mac and I discovered how finicky Cocoa really is. I was particularly shocked because I always remembered Cocoa as a particularly nice set of APIs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, a <em>big</em> problem that Mr. Ronge does not mention is that there is very little information available online to help a macOS developer work through anything but the most basic situations. Sure, you can find some tutorials on <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/macos">raywenderlich.com</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDg-YmnNehm3KB0BpytkUJg">YouTube</a>, but once you go beyond the basics, good information is hard to find.</p>

<p>If you search for “How do I do X? on iOS” you will likely find dozens or hundreds of hits, including numerous tutorials, open source libraries, and Stack Overflow questions. Conversely, you will be lucky to find one or two resources for the query “How do I do X? on macOS” (or OS X).</p>

<p>It is understandable, because iOS is such a huge platform, but it is also quite frustrating, at least to a solo developer like me. If Apple creates <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps">a new framework</a> or shim layer to let us use iOS frameworks on macOS, I think it would make making Mac apps a lot easier for predominantly iOS-oriented developers like me..</p>

  <p>The first thing you will notice when you set up 1Blocker X on an iOS device is its 7 toggles in Safari’s Content Blocker section of the Settings app. It’s a bit of a head-scratcher at first until you realize that this is what allows 1Blocker X to expand beyond the confines of its predecessor.</p>

  <p>You see, iOS limits the number of blocking rules that can be implemented by an app to 50,000. That’s a lot of rules, but sadly not enough given the amount of junk on the Internet these days. As a result, it’s a limit that 1Blocker began to run into not long after it launched in 2015.</p>

  <p>Finding a way around that hard limit required a rewrite of 1Blocker from the ground up. The result is 1Blocker X, an app with around three times as many blocking rules, room to grow, and enhanced flexibility for applying those rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think I really needed to replace the content blocker I had been using, but it hadn’t been updated in a really long time, so I’m not sure it’s blocking rules are up-to-date.</p>

<p>Much of the work these things do is invisilble. It’s easy to see if ads are blocked, of course, but not so with trackers and malware, which I care more about. At home I <em>also</em> block ads at the DNS level using <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>, running on an old Raspberry Pi. I heartily recommend setting up a Pi-hole (it’s easy; there are tutorials to follow). I miss having it when I’m out of the house, which is why a content blocker is helpful, too.</p>

<p>So far, 1Blocker X has been working just fine. I’ve noticed no decrease in speed from Safari, despite the crazy amount of blocking rules I have enabled.</p>
