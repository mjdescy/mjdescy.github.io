      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/koko-gorilla-death-sign-language.html">Koko the Gorilla</a> was a subject of fascination for me as a child. But, like many my age, I suspect, I kind of forgot about her, except for when she popped up in college psychology textbooks or NY Times crosswork clues every so often. I’m embarassed to say that I didn’t know Koko was still alive for most of my life. Rest in peace.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/06/19/general-electric-dropped.html">General Electric Dropped from Dow</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/business/dealbook/general-electric-dow-jones.html">It’s the end of an era.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, don’t even get me started as to the idiocy of following a price-weighted stock index in the age of computers, but being part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average">DJIA</a> is a huge badge of honor that G.E. has now lost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company’s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company’s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent decline of G.E. has been shocking to me. When I was at business school in Connecticut, G.E. was, rightly, considered a giant of industry and of financial services. Now it appears to be a lumbering giant, a lion in winter. I wonder what it will take to turn the company around.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/06/19/apple-didnt-kill.html">Apple Didn't Kill Appkit...</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>This <a href="http://subfurther.com/blog/2018/06/17/apple-didnt-kill-appkit-millenials-did/">article</a>, quite rightly, made me feel bad about not pushing through the troubles I had porting SwiftoDo to the Mac—a project I haven’t touched in over a year now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it really that hard to share a codebase between Mac and iOS? I just sent off the “other platforms” chapter of Xcode Treasures, and one of the sections is about creating multi-platform projects. The book shows how to add tvOS to an iOS project from earlier in the book, but the idea is the same regardless of which platforms you support: portion off the code you can into cross-platform frameworks, ideally leaving only platform-specific UI code in each platform’s targets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I modularized a lot of my code to allow it to happen someday, but found out that it would require a lot of work to ramp up my AppKit skills. All the data manipulation code is in a well-contained library. That’s just a small part of the app, though. The features are all in UI code, and porting it to AppKit resembles a 90% rewrite of my app.</p>

<p>If I was doing development professionally, I would have done it. But as a hobbyist, it’s hard to want to dive deep into AppKit when there are a million things to create or fix on iOS, which feels like Apple’s future platform anyway. Maybe I’m lazy, and maybe Apple is going to help me out with UIKit on the Mac twelve months from now.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/06/12/learning-the-core.html">Learning the Core Data Framework</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Lately I have taken it upon myself to finally teach myself <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html?utm_source=iosstash.io">Core Data</a>. I had avoided it for years, due to its complexity and because it was <em>too much</em> for my projects. I decided to learn it to challenge myself and to level up a bit as an iOS developer.</p>

<p>Learning it reminds me of learning Objective C and Cocoa years ago. Core Data presents itself as a daunting hierarchy of NS-prefixed classes, with lots of layers and moving parts, but it (kind of) makes sense after a long period of study. It’s starting to make sense to me now, though I have barely scratched the surface of its functionality.</p>

<p>I’ve been writing and rewriting and never finishing the same sample app for the past week. Of course, I made it difficult for myself by requiring it to have an App Group, and for the Core Data stack to be defined in its own Framework. I figured out how to do so a couple days ago, and then, this morning, stumbled on the exact same process recommended in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/224">Apple’s WWDC 2018 Core Data Best Practices video </a>. At least I know I got part of my Core Data stack set up the right way!</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>As much as I love Apple hardware, I’ve got a bunch of Apple hardware problems all of the sudden:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AirPod battery life has dropped to less than an hour for phone calls. My AirPods are about 18 months old.</li>
  <li>Bad backlight bleed developed on the bottom edge of my iPad Pro. Dark backgrounds obscure it, but light backgrounds don’t. I will see tomorrow if they will fix it under warranty. My iPad Pro is 11 months old.</li>
  <li>A bright spot developed in the bottom right corner of my iPhone 7 Plus. You can only see it when that section of the screen is displaying white. I’ll ask about it at the Genius Bar tomorrow. My iPhone is almost 20 months old. Luckily, it’s still covered by AppleCare+.</li>
  <li>My 2013 MacBook Pro started dropping my USB trackball upon or after going to sleep. I have to unplug and replug it to make it work again. Research has shown me that this sort of thing is one of those unknown bugs. I hope it doesn’t mean my logic board is going.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all minor quibbles, but they are all about rather expensive hardware. I think I’m going to start buying AppleCare+ from now on.</p>
