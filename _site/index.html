		<h1><a href="/2018/07/24/introducing-my-latest.html">Introducing my latest iOS app: Simple Call Blocker</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://simplecallblockerapp.com">Simple Call Blocker</a> is a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;mt=8">free app</a> for blocking unwanted calls on iOS.</p>

<p>It provides a basic way to block lots of numbers via a CallKit directory extension‚Äìwhich is great for blocking neighbor spam.</p>

<p>Unlike almost every other call blocker out there, mine is completely free and doesn‚Äôt need access to your contacts to work.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Try it out.</a> It‚Äôs free.</p>

<p>If you want to know more, there‚Äôs a <a href="https://simplecallblockerapp.com">website with screenshots and a FAQ</a>. I wrote a <a href="https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/introducing-simple-call-blocker/">blog post</a> describing my motivation for writing it, too.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I started listening to podcasts in 2008. I think, now, I am, for the first time, burnt out on the medium. I listen to a lot of podcasts while I work, but lately I‚Äôve found I can barely remember what the episodes were about shortly after they finish. I think I am tuning them out.</p>

<p>I am paring back my subscriptions down‚Äîway down‚Äîto a few favorites and listening to more music instead. It‚Äôs symmetrical to how I got into podcast listening: I was burnt out on listening to music all day long, and became uninterested in music for several years.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/07/17/trial-runs-for.html">Trial runs for fascism are in full flow</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/fintan-o-toole-trial-runs-for-fascism-are-in-full-flow-1.3543375">This article by Fintan O‚ÄôToole</a> in <em>The Irish Times</em> is a few weeks old now, but I keep thinking about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fascism doesn‚Äôt arise suddenly in an existing democracy. It is not easy to get people to give up their ideas of freedom and civility. You have to do trial runs that, if they are done well, serve two purposes. They get people used to something they may initially recoil from; and they allow you to refine and calibrate. This is what is happening now and we would be fools not to see it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. O‚ÄôToole lays out a simple and convincing argument outlining ideas that I have been mulling over in my head, but not writing much about, since Trump‚Äôs election on November 8, 2016. What has happened‚Äîat an accelerating pace, I think, since last year‚Äîis that the bounds of what is considered <em>normal</em> have been stretched so far into what was previously <em>outrageous</em> that I fear there is no going back. If Trump and the Republican Party are proving that the U.S. president is above the law, and that much of what governed the government was merely tradition, which is disposable for political expediency, then what, if anything, will constrain the power and the actions of future U.S. presidents?</p>
