    <h1>Om Malik's Shinola Canfield headphone review</h1>
  
  <div class="e-content">
  <p>Om Malik wrote <a href="https://om.co/2018/04/29/shinolas-canfield-headphones/">a thoughtful review</a> of a rather high end headphone, the Shinola Canfield. He includes his philosophy on what makes good headphones, and states that you can find really good headphones between $200 and $500, which I wholeheartedly agree with. I especially enjoyed learning about which headphones he keeps around:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>At home, I listen to Focal Clear, probably the best and the most expensive headphones I will ever owned. I have no desire to either upgrade or change these phones. […]</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For conference calls and phone conversations, I use Apple AirPods. They aren’t my choice for music, but for watching videos on my iPad, they are more than adequate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For long-haul flights, I have a pair of beat-up Bose headphones that take AA batteries and are as low-tech as Bose can get. They sit in my luggage and will be there until Bose stops making the replacement ear pads. They are not great for music, but on a loud aircraft, they are just a way to mute everything.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I love knowing that he and I have a similar lineup of headphones, and we split our time between them similarly: a top end headphone (except my top end are the Oppo PM-3, which cost a <em>lot</em> less than his Focal Clear); Apple AirPods for phone calls (I use them for calls, podcasts, and TV but almost never for music); and super old, now-crummy Bose for use on airplanes only.</p>
