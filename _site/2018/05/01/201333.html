  <div class="e-content">
  <p>Earlier this year, I completed reading <em><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One">Ready Player One</a></em> by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322">episode of the ‚ÄúTriangulation‚Äù podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir</a>, who enthusiastically recommended the book.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as ‚Äúthe reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games‚Äù. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.</p>
