  <div class="e-content">
  <p>I am trying to get back into <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, the reliable and, a few years ago, faddish, “antisocial” bookmarking service.</p>

<p>I had been using it as an archive of my old browser bookmarks, and as a “read it later” service to push articles to from Twitter and my RSS reader. I used to use it pretty consistently, with the help of an iOS app and a Chrome plugin for my Mac. When I went on an RSS and Twitter diet late last year, though, I kicked my Pinboard app off my phone as well. More recently, I wiped my Mac clean and reinstalled a bare minimum of apps and services, which did not include Chrome or the whatever Pinboard plugin I had been using with Safari. Since then, Safari and Google have been my bookmarking service, in that I don’t actually save any bookmarks, but rely on typing URLs or searches directly into the browser address bar most of the time.</p>

<p>Recently, in part because iOS supports it in the long-press menu on every URL, I have been saving links to Apple’s built-in Safari Reading List. Saving bookmarks is as low-friction as can be, but reading them is, paradoxically, very high friction for me. I never think to dig into the second panel within Safari’s bookmarks to look for something to read. Consequently, my Safari Reading List has become a graveyard for links that I (think I) want to read but probably never will. Maybe that’s what is is actually for, and maybe that’s what I actually need.</p>

<p>For fun, though, I’m going to try to use Pinboard more instead.</p>
