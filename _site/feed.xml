        <title>Google's music and video streaming strategy is a mess</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/17/google-play-youtube-music-premium-strategy/&quot;&gt;Engadget has it right&lt;/a&gt;. I have no idea what Google audio/video service I should ever consider subscribing to, and because music is tied in there, they don‚Äôt offer what I want (ad-free YouTube) at price that is reasonable to me. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter, because Google will just fold it and create an alternative service, with a different name, price, and product mix, in a couple years anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I rely on Google Search, and as much as I use, indifferently, Gmail, I just don‚Äôt understand Google as a company. Their central strategy appears to be ‚Äúno strategy‚Äù. They try stuff out, kill it if it fails, and iterate on what succeeds. This process is fun to watch when the company is a young startup, but is a bit much to bear when they are one of the four pillars of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my kids didn‚Äôt love YouTube, but hate the ads, I wouldn‚Äôt think about subscribing to YouTube Premium (or is it YouTube Red? or is it YouTube Music?) at all. If Google cared about customers like me‚Äîvery light YouTube viewers who would pay a small amount of money to not be interrupted by ads‚ÄîI would send them some money each month.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;cast&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Solo&lt;/em&gt; certainly is  appealing, even if &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/culture/2018/05/solo-the-new-star-wars-movie-reviewed.html&quot;&gt;the movie itself may be largely inconsequential&lt;/a&gt;. To think, I used to care more about the &lt;em&gt;director&lt;/em&gt; than the cast. üé¨&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;SwiftoDo 2.12.0 was looking pretty dire last night, but is now looking like it may be ready for release, thanks to some improvements I made today. I will do more testing this week to make sure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Work has been heating up for me lately, which is good all around, but a change nonetheless. It‚Äôs good to have lots of work to look forward to each day. It‚Äôs bad to feel like there‚Äôs so much you can‚Äôt finish each day, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been testing what I thought would be SwiftoDo‚Äôs next release build all day. All day, Dropbox has been throwing error messages, making me think my code is messed up. Now, the same code is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; throwing those error messages. It must be internet weather or something.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Spotify to Indie and Beyond: A Top Dev Interview With John Sundell</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this interview with Swift expert, blogger, and podcaster John Sundell (&lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/johnsundell&quot;&gt;@johnsundell&lt;/a&gt;):

        <title>üéµ Frightened Rabbit singer commits suicide üò•</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;(My original title was just an expletive.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44079462&quot;&gt;Body confirmed as missing Frightened Rabbit singer - BBC News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDepression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you‚Äù, it added.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúScott battled bravely with his own issues for many years and we are immensely proud of him for being so open with his struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHis willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm so upset. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; Frightened Rabbit. It was no secret that Scott Hutchison suffered from depression, anxiety, and who knows what else‚Äîit‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;all over&lt;/em&gt; his arch, wry lyrics. Go listen to ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/keep-yourself-warm/917524230?i=917524306&quot;&gt;Keep Yourself Warm&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù to get an idea of what a great singer/songwriter he was.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pure Gold from Pinboard's FAQ</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across this tonight, as I was perusing &lt;a href=&quot;https://pinboard.in/faq/#cjk_search&quot;&gt;Pinboard‚Äôs FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, trying to learn something different about the service that I have been ignoring for the past year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is it true the site admin can see private bookmarks?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yes. I routinely look at raw bookmark data, which includes private bookmarks. Most of the time this means I look at URLs without any identifying context.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I try to avoid looking at private data on people‚Äôs individual pages. However, this is sometimes necessary in order to diagnose and fix bugs in Pinboard, such as search errors, or strange formatting in archived pages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I use the metaphor of a hotel manager. I have a key that opens every room, but I try not to use it without a good reason. &lt;strong&gt;And I can assure everyone that five years of running this site has eliminated any trace of curiosity I might have had about what people bookmark.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Emphasis is my own. ü§£)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Best Trackballs according to Wirecutter</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wirecutter updated its &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-trackballs/?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=RSS%20Feed&quot;&gt;trackballs review&lt;/a&gt; today. Their recommendations are basically unchanged, which is no surprise, because the entire trackball market has been stagnant for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of evolution in trackballs, I am a huge fan of them. I credit swapping my mouse for a trackball with reducing, to almost nothing, repetitive stress injuries from computing. I find trackballs to be more comfortable to use and more precise than both mice and trackpads. I actually have one for each my my machines (Mac and PC), and bring the smaller one with me when I travel for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt quibble with WireCutter‚Äôs top pick, but I disagree with their assessment of my main trackball, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kensington.com/en/ae/4493/k72327eu/slimblade-trackball&quot;&gt;Kensington SlimBlade&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Instead of using a hardware scroll ring as on the Kensington Expert Mouse and Orbit with Scroll Ring, with the Kensington SlimBlade Trackball you have to rotate the ball to scroll, which is tough to do without bouncing the cursor around the screen. The SlimBlade‚Äôs buttons feel hollow compared with the Expert Mouse‚Äôs, and its shiny plastic and metal surfaces attract fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, its buttons could be a little clickier, but rotating the ball to scroll without moving the cursor is actually pretty easy. Unlike the Expert Mouse, the SlimBlade doesn‚Äôt have an unnecessarily steep angle to it, so you can use it comfortably without a wrist rest. And, honestly, saying its ‚Äúsurfaces attract fingerprints‚Äù is just plain stupid. My iPad Pro screen, which is the finest screen in my entire house, ‚Äúattracts fingerprints‚Äù too. I think product reviewers need to strike that quibble off their list.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Improving Dropbox-related error messages in SwiftoDo</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve done a lot of work rewriting the Dropbox code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftodoapp.com&quot;&gt;SwiftoDo&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, any error messages it generates are a now a little less well written‚Äîthey are more generic‚Äîbut they will appear more quickly, with greater consistency, and will reappear (as you would expect) each time Dropbox is accessed until the problem is fixed. Plus, the new error messages will provide a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; more information about what went wrong than they did before. I hope it‚Äôs the right tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üéµ Okkervil River's back catalog</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Listening to Okkervil River‚Äôs new album, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-the-rainbow-rain/1342462882&quot;&gt;In the Rainbow Rain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, today gave me an excuse to dive, once again, into their back catalog. I am a huge fan of the band‚Äôs 2005-2008 work, a trifecta of literate rock albums: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/black-sheep-boy-10th-anniversary-edition/1036936862&quot;&gt;Black Sheep Boy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stand-ins/543561172&quot;&gt;The Stand Ins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stage-names-bonus-track-version/453256340&quot;&gt;The Stage Names&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Each of these albums is a staggering artistic achievement; each song on them is an evocative short story with enough weight, depth, and maturity to reward repeated listenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven‚Äôt spent nearly as many hours listening to their work since then, which which includes &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-silver-gymnasium/977288852&quot;&gt;The Silver Gymnasium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/away/1113050258&quot;&gt;Away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This, more recent, period is characterized by a darker, more somber tone. It‚Äôs easy to imagine the band‚Äôs frontman, and only consistent member now, Will Sheff, slowing down, looking back on life, and looking far forward to his eventual death. That‚Äôs way heavier stuff than what I normally listen to, but not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; heavy to be enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trying to get back into Pinboard, or, maybe I am over-complicating things</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to get back into &lt;a href=&quot;https://pinboard.in&quot;&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt;, the reliable and, a few years ago, faddish, ‚Äúantisocial‚Äù bookmarking service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been using it as an archive of my old browser bookmarks, and as a ‚Äúread it later‚Äù service to push articles to from Twitter and my RSS reader. I used to use it pretty consistently, with the help of an iOS app and a Chrome plugin for my Mac. When I went on an RSS and Twitter diet late last year, though, I kicked my Pinboard app off my phone as well. More recently, I wiped my Mac clean and reinstalled a bare minimum of apps and services, which did not include Chrome or the whatever Pinboard plugin I had been using with Safari. Since then, Safari and Google have been my bookmarking service, in that I don‚Äôt actually save any bookmarks, but rely on typing URLs or searches directly into the browser address bar most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, in part because iOS supports it in the long-press menu on every URL, I have been saving links to Apple‚Äôs built-in Safari Reading List. Saving bookmarks is as low-friction as can be, but reading them is, paradoxically, very high friction for me. I never think to dig into the second panel within Safari‚Äôs bookmarks to look for something to read. Consequently, my Safari Reading List has become a graveyard for links that I (think I) want to read but probably never will. Maybe that‚Äôs what is is actually for, and maybe that‚Äôs what I actually need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fun, though, I‚Äôm going to try to use Pinboard more instead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Robocalls Flooding Your Cellphone? Here‚Äôs How to Stop Them</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nyti.ms/2q5d7oj&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; inspired me to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://gethiya.app.link/phone-guard&quot;&gt;Hiya&lt;/a&gt; on my iPhone to block spam calls. I will find out eventually how well it works. I get 5-10 robocalls per week, mostly from the same exchange as my mobile number or my Google Voice number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to rely on a central service for all blocking rules, including an optional whitelist for your contacts and an optional rule based on your phone number for ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù spam. It can identify and block a gigantic list of known spammers and robocallers, which is beyond what I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having looked at it, and its competition, it seems like there isn‚Äôt a good on-device-only call blocker for the super-privacy conscious who, like me, only want to whitelist contacts and blacklist all other numbers in a couple of area codes and exchanges. I really want to write one. It would have to be free, I think, based on the free competition out there‚Äîbut it may fit a particular niche that is out there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Plus still exists. Why?</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven‚Äôt thought about this in a long time, but I am actually surprised that &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Plus&lt;/a&gt; still exists. Considering how many products Google launches and kills each year for practically no reason, it‚Äôs astounding that one of its monumental flops has been allowed to limp along for so many years. I think it must still be around because either it still generates signals for Google (how many though, compared to other things?), or because it was tied in, at a technical level, to more valuable and integral services like Gmail. All I know is that its continued presence in the Google portfolio serves as yet another reminder to me about how unfocused Google is as an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm making 12-bean soup today, in an effort to get back to eating home-cooked, wholesome foods. Every few months, as work and family commitments change, my family gets off track. Hopefully we can right the ship now that is is spring.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My 300th post on Micro.blog</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;According to my Account page, this is my 300th post on Micro.blog. I thought I would share some stats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Micro.blog posts: 300&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Days on the platform: 136 (joined 2017-12-19)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average posts per day: 2.2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many people I follow: 131&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many people follow me: I have no idea, and that is fine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much engagement I get from other users: a pleasingly good amount&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much I happily paid Manton for Micro.blog hosting thus far: $30 USD ($5/month, not including the free trial period)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How little I could have paid, if I wanted: $0 for a WordPress.com blog or $1/month for an inexpensive WordPress host, plus the free Micro.blog account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micro.blog has gotten me into blogging again after a long time away from it. I enjoy owning my own content, the focus on &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; rather than liking or retweeting, and, most of all, the lack of &lt;em&gt;friction&lt;/em&gt; in the platform.  Posting short or long form content is as simple as can be, and I don‚Äôt have a WordPress install and/or server to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am having fun on the platform and look forward to continuing to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google News is getting more video</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17320190/google-news-update-video-youtube-amp&quot;&gt;Google News is getting a revamp with more video and faster load times - The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Google is giving Google News a redesign that will bring in elements from its Newsstand app and YouTube, according to sources who spoke with AdAge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More video? Gee, no thanks! Maybe I should give Apple News a try again‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üéµ Groundhog Day the Musical</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/groundhog-day-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1215389487&quot;&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is my second favorite Broadway musical of last year (closely behind ‚ÄúDear Evan Hansen‚Äù, which has more plot-related problems but really terrific music), and the only one I saw. I revisit the cast album from time to time, because it is terrific, and multiple listens reveal hidden depth in the earthy lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-CD-Review-GROUNDHOG-DAY-THE-MUSICAL-Original-Broadway-Cast-Recording-is-Charmingly-Animated-20170516&quot;&gt;Broadway World‚Äôs review of the cast album&lt;/a&gt; is remarkably spot on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On first listen, Minchin‚Äôs melodies are captivating. They are undeniably more poppy than his dark, moody, and undulating score for MATILDA; however, it‚Äôs obvious that he has written each of these compositions with the same consideration and care that he did with MATILDA. Despite the more simplistic sounding and pop aural soundscape, the melodies are intricately layered showing an artistry and skill that is not apparent in one listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope Tim Minchin keeps writing musicals. His music and lyrics for his prior show, &lt;em&gt;Matilda&lt;/em&gt;, are a masterpiece. (Listen to the London cast recording over the Broadway one if you can; it is a &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; better performance, though it is missing some of Matilda‚Äôs monologues.) ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite rank as a masterpiece in my book, but it is really, really good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Listening to Podcasts without Voice Boost</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; accustomed to listening to Podcasts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs ‚ÄúVoice Boost‚Äù feature that, when I turn it off (as I‚Äôm doing today, because my Bluetooth headphones are too loud) my podcasts sound flat and lifeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder, though, why more podcast producers don‚Äôt run their episodes through dynamic compression and EQ filters (‚ÄúVoice Boost‚Äù) prior to publishing. For that matter, why don‚Äôt they ‚Äúshorten silences‚Äù on their end, too? That way, everyone could benefit from better audio quality and a shorter runtime. I suspect that some of big, radio-show-based podcasts do, but it‚Äôs obvious that most other podcasts don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 2017 Panic Report</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://panic.com/blog/the-2017-panic-report/&quot;&gt;Panic Report&lt;/a&gt; is always worth a read. I use a lot of their apps, and have long considered them an app studio so talented that I will buy whatever they make, so long as I can sometimes use it. They are refreshingly open and honest about their business, too. Their annual reports are especially eye opening if you are a developer and are curious about the business aspects of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this part, toward the end, was kind of funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ë® I‚Äôm using Transmit 5 as my primary interface to Dropbox. Am I a bad person? ‚ÄîKyle&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Absolutely not. This is so potentially powerful, we even made a video about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt install Dropbox on my Mac anymore. Instead, I now use iCloud Drive for cross-device sync. I use Transmit 5 to get to Dropbox, the few times I need it. It seems weird to do so at first, but it is much lighter on resources, if you don‚Äôt need file sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,

        <title>Two of the best platformers I've played on iOS are getting their due today from Apple</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Apple‚Äôs US App Store is highlighting two great games that are among the best on the platform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1356375657&quot;&gt;Game of the Day: Goblin Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Goblin Sword plays like a AAA title from the 16-bit days, and has great play control, difficulty, and variety. It‚Äôs fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1369365671&quot;&gt;Games Are Art: The Beauty of Oddmar&lt;/a&gt;. I learned about Oddmar from someone else on micro.blog, and have only played through a handful of levels. The play controls are unique and well suited for the iPhone, and the graphics and sound are amazing. It‚Äôs a fun and funny game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Remote login Inception</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At work, our clients are far more interested in information security than they used to be. That‚Äôs great, and I applaud them for it. Of course, as a user of their systems, there is a trade-off in terms of convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, logging into remote systems seems like entering a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream‚Äîa la &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of merely using Remote Desktop to log into systems with a single username/password, we now follow in-depth login procedures using virtualization software, RSA tokens that generate unique, one-time passwords, Remote Desktop logins, and systems logins.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who cares about Apple earnings reports?</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do Windows fans care about Microsoft‚Äôs earnings? Do Android fans care about Google‚Äôs? I wonder if the main reason Apple fans (non-investors) &lt;a href=&quot;https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/05/apple-quarterly-results-charts-live-tweets/&quot;&gt;cheer on Apple‚Äôs good earnings reports&lt;/a&gt; is that Apple almost went out of business in the 1990s. Unless the company is going out of business, or if you have tied a lot of your money up with them somehow, who cares about its quarterly earnings report?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üìö Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I completed reading &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One&quot;&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322&quot;&gt;episode of the ‚ÄúTriangulation‚Äù podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir&lt;/a&gt;, who enthusiastically recommended the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as ‚Äúthe reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games‚Äù. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The best part of working from home is the ability to take a nice walk after lunch. Spring weather was finally here at lunchtime, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Summer temperatures will follow by dinner time and last for the foreseeable future. So, that was spring!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I quit my iPhone for a basic Nokia and it was hard but worth it</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1264704/at-first-life-without-a-smartphone-was-terrifying-then-it-was-beautiful/&quot;&gt;This article on Quartz about limiting smartphone use&lt;/a&gt; is both sublime and ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to be present. Is that so much to ask for? Is that so odd to crave in this day and age?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Maybe you‚Äôre reading this thinking I‚Äôm taking it too far and being ridiculous. That it‚Äôs just a smartphone, people check them all the time and that‚Äôs just the way it is and I should get over it and get used to it. But being on it most of my free time feels wrong on every level. I don‚Äôt want to get used to it anymore. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to reduce the amount of time I spend looking at this damn screen instead of being with my own thoughts. It shouldn‚Äôt be this challenging. But it is. And that says tons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I wanted to do the same thing this author does‚Äîdowngrade from smartphone to dumbphone‚Äîbut to save money rather than to improve my contact with the outside world. My plan was to replace the smartphone with an iPad Mini, which I would use only on WiFi. Back then I shuttled every article I read from my RSS app (Reeder) to my read-it-later app (Pocket) and cached them offline, so I would rarely be without an offline time waster, to fill in those dull times in waiting rooms or on trains. I didn‚Äôt go through with the plan, though. I got caught up in smartphone fever along with everyone else in my office. It was an exciting time in the development of that technology‚Äîmuch more exciting than today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is interesting and admirable to try to limit your smartphone use, and it is fun to read about someone‚Äôs experience with it. I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; think that this essay is the sort of thing my grandchildren will read in history class, perhaps on the whatever slab of glass and silicon they carry, and laugh at how silly we were to distrust the most transformative technology of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30&quot;&gt;The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things‚Äîand to try old things again. In that spirit, we‚Äôre launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It‚Äôll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker puzzle is a &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I‚Äôm not a strong player), but I‚Äôm happy there‚Äôs another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prolific Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo departs KGI Securities, likely to focus on companies other than Apple</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi/&quot;&gt;Kuo‚Äôs departure&lt;/a&gt; comes hot off the heels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/13/apple-memo-on-leaks-leaks/&quot;&gt;Apple‚Äôs recent ‚Äúleaked‚Äù memo&lt;/a&gt; about leaking that threatened the leaky leaders who leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple‚Äôs recent memo and strong stance against leaks ‚Äî supply chain or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn‚Äôt mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors,  they don‚Äôt really benefit Apple fans that much.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Om Malik's Shinola Canfield headphone review</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Om Malik wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2018/04/29/shinolas-canfield-headphones/&quot;&gt;a thoughtful review&lt;/a&gt; of a rather high end headphone, the Shinola Canfield. He includes his philosophy on what makes good headphones, and states that you can find really good headphones between $200 and $500, which I wholeheartedly agree with. I especially enjoyed learning about which headphones he keeps around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At home, I listen to Focal Clear, probably the best and the most expensive headphones I will ever owned. I have no desire to either upgrade or change these phones. [‚Ä¶]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For conference calls and phone conversations, I use Apple AirPods. They aren‚Äôt my choice for music, but for watching videos on my iPad, they are more than adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For long-haul flights, I have a pair of beat-up Bose headphones that take AA batteries and are as low-tech as Bose can get. They sit in my luggage and will be there until Bose stops making the replacement ear pads. They are not great for music, but on a loud aircraft, they are just a way to mute everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love knowing that he and I have a similar lineup of headphones, and we split our time between them similarly: a top end headphone (except my top end are the Oppo PM-3, which cost a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; less than his Focal Clear); Apple AirPods for phone calls (I use them for calls, podcasts, and TV but almost never for music); and super old, now-crummy Bose for use on airplanes only.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I miss Caesar salad</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681&quot;&gt;our current, worsening outbreak&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country‚Äôs will to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it‚Äôs worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.&lt;/p&gt;

I am still a bit puzzled why I watched it. I guess I‚Äôm a sucker for Batman and for animation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üìö How We Got To Now</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading Steen Johnson‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html&quot;&gt;How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World&lt;/a&gt;. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson‚Äôs writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it‚Äôs a wonderful read to anyone who loves the ‚Äúhistory of ideas course‚Äù way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments‚Äî‚Äúhummingbird effects‚Äù and ‚Äúthe adjacent possible‚Äù‚Äîthat I particularly like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Finland Has Second Thoughts About Giving Free Money to Jobless People</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nyti.ms/2HpHmQE&quot;&gt;Finland is letting its yearlong experiment with Universal Basic Income expire&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out giving out tax money to people with no strings attached isn‚Äôt widely popular. What is interesting to me, a US citizen, is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn a sense,‚Äù said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, ‚ÄúFinland already has basic income.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I support Universal Basic Income. I think it would help the poor and would spur more people, like me, to start their own businesses. Of course, if we in the US had government provided healthcare, education, and job training programs, it might be enough to spur new business creation. I have the talent to start a consultancy, but the responsibility to pay for healthcare and my children‚Äôs education has always made me feel more secure with a normal, salaried position.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amazon is increasing its Prime membership fee</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/amazon-doubles-its-profit---and-hikes-prime-membership-by-20/2018/04/26/31f5a14c-489a-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html?utm_term=.ff2227bbf7cb&quot;&gt;Amazon is increasing the price of Prime membership&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon also said it will hike its Prime membership fee 20 percent to $119 a year for new members beginning May 11. Existing members who renew their Prime memberships will have to pay the new rate beginning June 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perversely, this news is making me want to buy &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; from them, to get a better value on shipping. I bet Amazon is expecting that response from some of their most loyal customers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mac apps are harder than iOS apps</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I agree with Matt Ronge‚Äôs article ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/astro-hq/mac-apps-are-harder-than-ios-apps-614338e2e470&quot;&gt;Mac apps are harder than iOS apps&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was surprised when a recent project brought me back to the Mac and I discovered how finicky Cocoa really is. I was particularly shocked because I always remembered Cocoa as a particularly nice set of APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; problem that Mr. Ronge does not mention is that there is very little information available online to help a macOS developer work through anything but the most basic situations. Sure, you can find some tutorials on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/macos&quot;&gt;raywenderlich.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDg-YmnNehm3KB0BpytkUJg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, but once you go beyond the basics, good information is hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search for ‚ÄúHow do I do X? on iOS‚Äù you will likely find dozens or hundreds of hits, including numerous tutorials, open source libraries, and Stack Overflow questions. Conversely, you will be lucky to find one or two resources for the query ‚ÄúHow do I do X? on macOS‚Äù (or OS X).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is understandable, because iOS is such a huge platform, but it is also quite frustrating, at least to a solo developer like me. If Apple creates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps&quot;&gt;a new framework&lt;/a&gt; or shim layer to let us use iOS frameworks on macOS, I think it would make making Mac apps a lot easier for predominantly iOS-oriented developers like me..&lt;/p&gt;
