        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple‚Äôs Music app needs multiple selection on its playlist editor. It is tedious to remove albums I have listened to from my personal ‚Äúnew music‚Äù playlist. It is easier to manage on iTunes, but I hardly ever listen to music via my Mac anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Joe Steel's Guide to Mastodon</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joe-steel.com/2018-08-20-First-Time-Tooter-Long-Time-Tweeter.html&quot;&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; is a great overview of Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In conversations I‚Äôve had over the past week, it‚Äôs become clear that there‚Äôs nothing very self-explanatory about Mastodon as a social network, and that in many ways Twitter users are both prepared and unprepared for the experience. There are a lot of things that are similar in concept, but there‚Äôs more to it when it comes to how it‚Äôs a ‚Äúservice‚Äù that can really throw people for a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Mastodon &lt;em&gt;a little&lt;/em&gt;, but don‚Äôt really feel strongly one way or another towards the platform. I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to like it more. I was super enthusiastic about its predecessors, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_social&quot;&gt;StatusNet&lt;/a&gt; (nee Laconica, now GNU Social), but those failed to gain significant momentum, and became overrun with spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite whatever is new and exciting about Mastodon‚Äôs web UI, open web features, etc., it doesn‚Äôt feel that new or exciting to me. It feels like a better StatusNet. I suppose, though, that I care more about writing and posting content, and owning it, than about the ephemeral and chatty aspects of social networking.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm debugging iOS Files access in SwiftoDo this evening. It feels like ages since I worked on this app. During my 2-week vacation, I was exploring UI and navigation ideas I have for a &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; version of SwiftoDo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It looks like iOS 12 will extend the life of my old iOS hardware</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought my iPad Air 2 almost a year after it was released, only a few months before the first iPad Pro was released. I was a little worried at the time that I would get only a couple years out of it before iOS updates rendered it obsolete. I have been pleasantly surprised that that day has not yet arrived‚Äîand, based on how the iOS 12 beta is running, that day will not arrive for at least another year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, I finally installed the iOS 12 beta on it, and found the new OS to be smooth, stable, and fast. All my apps (even the ones I wrote!) are working just fine. As Apple promised, UI and animation-related things like scrolling are visibly faster and smoother, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to install iOS 12 beta on my iPhone 7 Plus in early September, after I complete my next release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftodoapp.com&quot;&gt;SwiftoDo&lt;/a&gt;. Based what I‚Äôm seeing, performance wise, on my even-older iPad Air 2, I‚Äôm looking forward to at least one more year of service from my iPhone 7 Plus, too. (It helps that my phone has a brand new battery and a new screen, thanks to AppleCare Plus.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The New Dark Sky App</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark Sky released a ground-up &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.darksky.net/the-new-dark-sky-app/&quot;&gt;rewrite of their flagship iOS app&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most noticeable change is the introduction of a new unified timeline. Rather than separating the forecast onto multiple pages, we now combine the current conditions, next hour rain forecast, next 24 hours, and next week forecasts into a single scrollable view that lets you quickly get to the part of the forecast you care about. This makes it much easier to scan what will happen in the minutes, hours, and days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Sky version 1.0, which was singularly focused on precipitation warnings and maps for your immediate vicinity, was probably my favorite iteration of the app. It wasn‚Äôt a full-fledged weather app at the time, but its singular focus was useful for me whenever I wanted to step out of the house or office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Weather Line, which uses Dark Sky weather data, almost exclusively for the past couple years, because its information layout was denser and more useful. This update may bring me back to Dark Sky, however. I‚Äôm moving it back to my home screen and will give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am fully back from vacation now, trying to get back into the swing of things at work. Fortunately for me, I had good people covering for me, and almost nothing I had to do for work over the past two weeks. The mad rush will resume today, I‚Äôm sure. üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I rewatched ‚ÄúAvengers: Age of Infinity‚Äù and my loved it. I actually liked it better the second time. If 20-year-old me knew that nearly-40-year-old me would prefer comic book movies to nearly everything else‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think we would be friends.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been seriously considering holding on to my iPhone 7 Plus for a third year. I just got a new screen and a new battery, It looks almost brand new, I still like the camera, I never complain about it being slow, and iOS 12 promises to improve performance when I upgrade to it. I feel the same way about my Series 1 Apple Watch, too, though my desire to upgrade it to whatever model Apple releases next is still a lot higher.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing my latest iOS app: Simple Call Blocker</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecallblockerapp.com&quot;&gt;Simple Call Blocker&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;free app&lt;/a&gt; for blocking unwanted calls on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides a basic way to block lots of numbers via a CallKit directory extension‚Äìwhich is great for blocking neighbor spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike almost every other call blocker out there, mine is completely free and doesn‚Äôt need access to your contacts to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Try it out.&lt;/a&gt; It‚Äôs free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more, there‚Äôs a &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecallblockerapp.com&quot;&gt;website with screenshots and a FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/introducing-simple-call-blocker/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; describing my motivation for writing it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I left my iPhone at the Apple Store for a screen repair and a new battery. I‚Äôm using my Essential Phone as an actual phone for the first time this afternoon. I do not plan to write a ‚Äúswitching post‚Äù though‚Äîit‚Äôs just temporary. üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I find myself shifting my listening time away from podcasts and more toward music lately</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started listening to podcasts in 2008. I think, now, I am, for the first time, burnt out on the medium. I listen to a lot of podcasts while I work, but lately I‚Äôve found I can barely remember what the episodes were about shortly after they finish. I think I am tuning them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am paring back my subscriptions down‚Äîway down‚Äîto a few favorites and listening to more music instead. It‚Äôs symmetrical to how I got into podcast listening: I was burnt out on listening to music all day long, and became uninterested in music for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;üéµ I‚Äôm back to my wired OPPO PM-3 &amp;amp; HA-2 SE headphones stack today, listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/foreverland-deluxe-version/1114549349&quot;&gt;Foreverland&lt;/a&gt;, by The Divine Comedy. It‚Äôs an album that slipped by me in 2016. I used to love The Divine Comedy in the late 1990s, and still take &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/casanova/162993522&quot;&gt;Casanova&lt;/a&gt; for a spin every six months or so.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trial runs for fascism are in full flow</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/fintan-o-toole-trial-runs-for-fascism-are-in-full-flow-1.3543375&quot;&gt;This article by Fintan O‚ÄôToole&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Irish Times&lt;/em&gt; is a few weeks old now, but I keep thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fascism doesn‚Äôt arise suddenly in an existing democracy. It is not easy to get people to give up their ideas of freedom and civility. You have to do trial runs that, if they are done well, serve two purposes. They get people used to something they may initially recoil from; and they allow you to refine and calibrate. This is what is happening now and we would be fools not to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. O‚ÄôToole lays out a simple and convincing argument outlining ideas that I have been mulling over in my head, but not writing much about, since Trump‚Äôs election on November 8, 2016. What has happened‚Äîat an accelerating pace, I think, since last year‚Äîis that the bounds of what is considered &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; have been stretched so far into what was previously &lt;em&gt;outrageous&lt;/em&gt; that I fear there is no going back. If Trump and the Republican Party are proving that the U.S. president is above the law, and that much of what governed the government was merely tradition, which is disposable for political expediency, then what, if anything, will constrain the power and the actions of future U.S. presidents?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm super pleased listening to these V-Moda Crossfade 2 Codex Edition headphones all day at work, over Bluetooth. (Wireless use is pretty rare for me.) Great sound. Great isolation. The top of my head is a little sore from the headband, though. (They are kind of heavy.) üéß&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I checked out the new MacBook Pros at the Apple Store. The new keyboard looks (feels) like a winner to me. It is quieter, and there‚Äôs a good chance it won‚Äôt have the same reliability problem as the prior generation. I would prefer a 15‚Äù one without the TouchBar, though, but don‚Äôt plan to buy one until my 2015 rMBP breaks or is no longer supported.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our appointment for family photos at the park got canceled today due to heavy rain. We ended up shopping and eating pancakes instead. Not a bad trade-off for the day, but I would have liked to have the photos later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I both love and hate articles like ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/opinion/new-york-yankees-evil.html&quot;&gt;The New York Yankees Are a Moral Abomination&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù. Handwringing, declinist arguments about baseball are almost as old as baseball itself. ‚ÄúBaseball is in decline‚Äù is part of its brand‚Äîpart that needs to go away, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseball is awesome. The players are very skillful, play a game that doesn‚Äôt involve hurting each other, and legitimately appear to be enjoying themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started replaying Bastion on my IPad Pro tonight. I bought it years ago and never finished it. I‚Äôm using a controller and headphones this time around, which improve the experience. I‚Äôm better at combat than I used to be, but a lot worse at the proving grounds challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A git commit somehow disappeared, eradicating all my app code and obliterating at least one evening‚Äôs worth of work.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple‚Äôs App Review rejected my new app, primarily because its name had the word ‚Äúfree‚Äù in it. While that‚Äôs not the end of the world, it will delay the app‚Äôs release for at least a couple days, as I figure out a new name and the best way to handle everything in App Store Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
