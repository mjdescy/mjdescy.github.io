        <title>üéÆ Transistor</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished the game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/&quot;&gt;Transistor&lt;/a&gt; last night. I played it on my iPad Pro with a MFi controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fun game with a great atmosphere (setting, sound design, visual design, etc.) but the story was a bit too opaque for my taste. You had to dig into the user interface and read a bunch of optional stuff to get a better idea of what is going on ints its disintegrating cyberpunk world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ended kind of abruptly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; had a tragic ending, which is unusual, but maybe not for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supergiantgames.com/&quot;&gt;game studio&lt;/a&gt;. Their prior game, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/bastion/&quot;&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, also had kind of a downer ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure if I will do a replay of Transister, but I‚Äôm happy that I played it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptocurrency Mining Now Accounts for Approximately One Percent of the World‚Äôs Energy Consumption</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/6047/bitcoin-mining-accounts-for-almost-one-percent-of-the-worlds-energy-consumption&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is shameful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In his testimony, Narayanan estimates that Bitcoin mining now uses about five gigawatts of electricity per day (in May, estimates of Bitcoin power consumption were about half of that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a waste. We, as a species, could do so much better with our intellect and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How One Silicon Valley C.E.O. Masters Work-Life Balance  </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Articles like &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyti.ms/2o6XKJH?smid=nytcore-ios-share&quot;&gt;this one from the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; are meant to be inspiring, I think. But learning how a CEO manages his time is not that valuable for any non-CEO to learn about, simply because a CEO doesn‚Äôt have a boss whose demands and whims make time management impossible sometimes. What makes time management difficult‚Äîand stressful‚Äîis not just whatever the workload is: it is &lt;em&gt;lack of control&lt;/em&gt; over your schedule, location, and what you are doing. I‚Äôd rather hear about people 1-3 levels down from the CEO about how they manage their time. Their stories would be more relatable, though they would sell fewer papers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üéµ Vocal Jazz with the V-Moda Crossfade Wireless 2</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today felt like a good day to listen to a long vocal jazz playlist through my V Moda Crossfade Wireless 2. Their warm, somewhat bass-y sound signature works surprisingly well for that genre. I mostly think of them as great for rock and pop music, but they handled sparse arrangements of vocals (male and female), piano, bass, and drums (mostly brushwork) surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to use wired mode because the Bluetooth connection is too loud for me, even at the lowest volume setting, on my iOS devices. The Bluetooth volume level appears to be more sane when I use them with my Apple TV or Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My speakers over the years</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems. My goal was to trace my journey from a normal person to an audiophile, as I upgrade my gear up over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/10/speakers-over-the-years/&quot;&gt;Speakers over the years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/11/my-first-speaker-system/&quot;&gt;My first speaker system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/12/sony-cfd-510-boombox/&quot;&gt;Sony CFD 510 Boombox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/13/my-first-computer-speakers/&quot;&gt;My first computer speakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/14/altec-lansing-computer-speakers-for-dell/&quot;&gt;Altec Lansing computer speakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/15/harman-kardon-soundsticks-ii-speaker-system/&quot;&gt;Harman Kardon Soundsticks II Speaker System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers that I have had are nothing special, but they are special, in a way, to me, because of all the music I listened to through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to write another, hopefully more interesting, series about my various headphones in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I miss Apple's Aperture</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-history-of-aperture/&quot;&gt;Stephen Hackett‚Äôs piece&lt;/a&gt; says about Apple‚Äôs Aperture‚Äîmainly about its shortcomings‚Äîmay be true, it does not reflect that, from a UI standpoint, Aperture was a masterpiece. From not locking you into specific modes or workflows, to having sensible single-key keyboard shortcuts for nearly every command, it was an absolute joy to use. I used it for almost its entire product lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Apple announced its end of life, I tried to move to Adobe Lightroom, and just hated it. I stuck with Aperture until over a year into the life of Apple‚Äôs current Photos app. I still miss Aperture‚Äôs editing tools, and would really be sore about it if my digital cameras today were as bad as the ones I had back in 2005-2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Photos is a decent replacement now that it has gone through several iterations. I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wish it had retouching support on the iPad, though. (It is current Mac-only.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I fixed a crash. Now I am a golden god! üßú‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I fixed the SwiftoDo chrasher that I griped about this afternoon, and, to future-me‚Äôs chagrin, I stayed up late to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking down the problem was tricky, but I eventually discovered that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIDocument&lt;/code&gt;‚Äôs &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;revert&lt;/code&gt; method was failing because sometimes it was being executed on a closed file. It turns out that I was not interrogating &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIDocument.documentState&lt;/code&gt; correctly when checking for ‚Äúclosed‚Äù file state. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;documentState&lt;/code&gt; property is an OptionSet, and has a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;contains&lt;/code&gt; method that is more appropriate to use than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, that what I think right now. I‚Äôll test my app out for a day or two and see if the nasty crash bug rears its head again, or moves to a new call site.&lt;/p&gt;

I started it around 11 PM last night and completely lost track of time until 12:30 AM. I am still doing pretty well with gaming on my iPad Pro with a controller, rather than buying a Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alas, no SwiftoDo update submission to the App Store today</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was planning to submit to the App Store the current build of SwiftoDo, which I have been testing without incident for about three weeks. Unfortunately, out of nowhere, it started crashing on launch late this morning. Fortunately, I never finished submitting this build to the App Store for review, so it will never reach users. It does mean, however, that I have to debug a tricky treading-related crash before I can release the cool new feature I have been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My 1-week free trial to Marvel Unlimited trial ends today</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to decide if I‚Äôm going to end it, roll it forward month-to-month via an App Store subscription, or pay for an ultimately cheaper annual subscription via Marvel‚Äôs web site. I thought, for fun, I would start reading one comic book per day, and think that justifies the subscription price. I am enjoying the service, but I have, historically, only read comics in short, intense bursts every couple years, so I‚Äôm not sure if I will really stick with it once I read through the series I started. Of course, now I‚Äôm hooked on Brian Michael Bendis‚Äôs run of &lt;em&gt;All-New X-Men&lt;/em&gt;, so I predict I will renew the subscription in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple‚Äôs Music app needs multiple selection on its playlist editor. It is tedious to remove albums I have listened to from my personal ‚Äúnew music‚Äù playlist. It is easier to manage on iTunes, but I hardly ever listen to music via my Mac anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Joe Steel's Guide to Mastodon</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joe-steel.com/2018-08-20-First-Time-Tooter-Long-Time-Tweeter.html&quot;&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; is a great overview of Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In conversations I‚Äôve had over the past week, it‚Äôs become clear that there‚Äôs nothing very self-explanatory about Mastodon as a social network, and that in many ways Twitter users are both prepared and unprepared for the experience. There are a lot of things that are similar in concept, but there‚Äôs more to it when it comes to how it‚Äôs a ‚Äúservice‚Äù that can really throw people for a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Mastodon &lt;em&gt;a little&lt;/em&gt;, but don‚Äôt really feel strongly one way or another towards the platform. I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to like it more. I was super enthusiastic about its predecessors, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_social&quot;&gt;StatusNet&lt;/a&gt; (nee Laconica, now GNU Social), but those failed to gain significant momentum, and became overrun with spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite whatever is new and exciting about Mastodon‚Äôs web UI, open web features, etc., it doesn‚Äôt feel that new or exciting to me. It feels like a better StatusNet. I suppose, though, that I care more about writing and posting content, and owning it, than about the ephemeral and chatty aspects of social networking.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm debugging iOS Files access in SwiftoDo this evening. It feels like ages since I worked on this app. During my 2-week vacation, I was exploring UI and navigation ideas I have for a &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; version of SwiftoDo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It looks like iOS 12 will extend the life of my old iOS hardware</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought my iPad Air 2 almost a year after it was released, only a few months before the first iPad Pro was released. I was a little worried at the time that I would get only a couple years out of it before iOS updates rendered it obsolete. I have been pleasantly surprised that that day has not yet arrived‚Äîand, based on how the iOS 12 beta is running, that day will not arrive for at least another year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, I finally installed the iOS 12 beta on it, and found the new OS to be smooth, stable, and fast. All my apps (even the ones I wrote!) are working just fine. As Apple promised, UI and animation-related things like scrolling are visibly faster and smoother, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to install iOS 12 beta on my iPhone 7 Plus in early September, after I complete my next release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftodoapp.com&quot;&gt;SwiftoDo&lt;/a&gt;. Based what I‚Äôm seeing, performance wise, on my even-older iPad Air 2, I‚Äôm looking forward to at least one more year of service from my iPhone 7 Plus, too. (It helps that my phone has a brand new battery and a new screen, thanks to AppleCare Plus.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The New Dark Sky App</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark Sky released a ground-up &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.darksky.net/the-new-dark-sky-app/&quot;&gt;rewrite of their flagship iOS app&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most noticeable change is the introduction of a new unified timeline. Rather than separating the forecast onto multiple pages, we now combine the current conditions, next hour rain forecast, next 24 hours, and next week forecasts into a single scrollable view that lets you quickly get to the part of the forecast you care about. This makes it much easier to scan what will happen in the minutes, hours, and days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Sky version 1.0, which was singularly focused on precipitation warnings and maps for your immediate vicinity, was probably my favorite iteration of the app. It wasn‚Äôt a full-fledged weather app at the time, but its singular focus was useful for me whenever I wanted to step out of the house or office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Weather Line, which uses Dark Sky weather data, almost exclusively for the past couple years, because its information layout was denser and more useful. This update may bring me back to Dark Sky, however. I‚Äôm moving it back to my home screen and will give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am fully back from vacation now, trying to get back into the swing of things at work. Fortunately for me, I had good people covering for me, and almost nothing I had to do for work over the past two weeks. The mad rush will resume today, I‚Äôm sure. üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been seriously considering holding on to my iPhone 7 Plus for a third year. I just got a new screen and a new battery, It looks almost brand new, I still like the camera, I never complain about it being slow, and iOS 12 promises to improve performance when I upgrade to it. I feel the same way about my Series 1 Apple Watch, too, though my desire to upgrade it to whatever model Apple releases next is still a lot higher.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing my latest iOS app: Simple Call Blocker</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecallblockerapp.com&quot;&gt;Simple Call Blocker&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;free app&lt;/a&gt; for blocking unwanted calls on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides a basic way to block lots of numbers via a CallKit directory extension‚Äìwhich is great for blocking neighbor spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike almost every other call blocker out there, mine is completely free and doesn‚Äôt need access to your contacts to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Try it out.&lt;/a&gt; It‚Äôs free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more, there‚Äôs a &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecallblockerapp.com&quot;&gt;website with screenshots and a FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/introducing-simple-call-blocker/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; describing my motivation for writing it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I find myself shifting my listening time away from podcasts and more toward music lately</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started listening to podcasts in 2008. I think, now, I am, for the first time, burnt out on the medium. I listen to a lot of podcasts while I work, but lately I‚Äôve found I can barely remember what the episodes were about shortly after they finish. I think I am tuning them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am paring back my subscriptions down‚Äîway down‚Äîto a few favorites and listening to more music instead. It‚Äôs symmetrical to how I got into podcast listening: I was burnt out on listening to music all day long, and became uninterested in music for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trial runs for fascism are in full flow</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/fintan-o-toole-trial-runs-for-fascism-are-in-full-flow-1.3543375&quot;&gt;This article by Fintan O‚ÄôToole&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Irish Times&lt;/em&gt; is a few weeks old now, but I keep thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fascism doesn‚Äôt arise suddenly in an existing democracy. It is not easy to get people to give up their ideas of freedom and civility. You have to do trial runs that, if they are done well, serve two purposes. They get people used to something they may initially recoil from; and they allow you to refine and calibrate. This is what is happening now and we would be fools not to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. O‚ÄôToole lays out a simple and convincing argument outlining ideas that I have been mulling over in my head, but not writing much about, since Trump‚Äôs election on November 8, 2016. What has happened‚Äîat an accelerating pace, I think, since last year‚Äîis that the bounds of what is considered &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; have been stretched so far into what was previously &lt;em&gt;outrageous&lt;/em&gt; that I fear there is no going back. If Trump and the Republican Party are proving that the U.S. president is above the law, and that much of what governed the government was merely tradition, which is disposable for political expediency, then what, if anything, will constrain the power and the actions of future U.S. presidents?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have pared back my Twitter following list to Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ole Begemann, which is sometimes weird and sometimes delightful, the few moments per week I check in on them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm super pleased listening to these V-Moda Crossfade 2 Codex Edition headphones all day at work, over Bluetooth. (Wireless use is pretty rare for me.) Great sound. Great isolation. The top of my head is a little sore from the headband, though. (They are kind of heavy.) üéß&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I checked out the new MacBook Pros at the Apple Store. The new keyboard looks (feels) like a winner to me. It is quieter, and there‚Äôs a good chance it won‚Äôt have the same reliability problem as the prior generation. I would prefer a 15‚Äù one without the TouchBar, though, but don‚Äôt plan to buy one until my 2015 rMBP breaks or is no longer supported.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our appointment for family photos at the park got canceled today due to heavy rain. We ended up shopping and eating pancakes instead. Not a bad trade-off for the day, but I would have liked to have the photos later.&lt;/p&gt;
