        <title>I miss Caesar salad</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681&quot;&gt;our current, worsening outbreak&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country‚Äôs will to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it‚Äôs worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;üé¨ &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7451284/&quot;&gt;Batman Ninja&lt;/a&gt; is easily one of the weirdest movies I have seen‚Äîand that includes actual anime. I am still a bit puzzled why I watched it. I guess I‚Äôm a sucker for Batman and for animation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üìö How We Got To Now</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading Steen Johnson‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html&quot;&gt;How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World&lt;/a&gt;. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson‚Äôs writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it‚Äôs a wonderful read to anyone who loves the ‚Äúhistory of ideas course‚Äù way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments‚Äî‚Äúhummingbird effects‚Äù and ‚Äúthe adjacent possible‚Äù‚Äîthat I particularly like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Finland Has Second Thoughts About Giving Free Money to Jobless People</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nyti.ms/2HpHmQE&quot;&gt;Finland is letting its yearlong experiment with Universal Basic Income expire&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out giving out tax money to people with no strings attached isn‚Äôt widely popular. What is interesting to me, a US citizen, is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn a sense,‚Äù said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, ‚ÄúFinland already has basic income.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I support Universal Basic Income. I think it would help the poor and would spur more people, like me, to start their own businesses. Of course, if we in the US had government provided healthcare, education, and job training programs, it might be enough to spur new business creation. I have the talent to start a consultancy, but the responsibility to pay for healthcare and my children‚Äôs education has always made me feel more secure with a normal, salaried position.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amazon is increasing its Prime membership fee</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/amazon-doubles-its-profit---and-hikes-prime-membership-by-20/2018/04/26/31f5a14c-489a-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html?utm_term=.ff2227bbf7cb&quot;&gt;Amazon is increasing the price of Prime membership&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon also said it will hike its Prime membership fee 20 percent to $119 a year for new members beginning May 11. Existing members who renew their Prime memberships will have to pay the new rate beginning June 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perversely, this news is making me want to buy &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; from them, to get a better value on shipping. I bet Amazon is expecting that response from some of their most loyal customers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mac apps are harder than iOS apps</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I agree with Matt Ronge‚Äôs article ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/astro-hq/mac-apps-are-harder-than-ios-apps-614338e2e470&quot;&gt;Mac apps are harder than iOS apps&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was surprised when a recent project brought me back to the Mac and I discovered how finicky Cocoa really is. I was particularly shocked because I always remembered Cocoa as a particularly nice set of APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; problem that Mr. Ronge does not mention is that there is very little information available online to help a macOS developer work through anything but the most basic situations. Sure, you can find some tutorials on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/macos&quot;&gt;raywenderlich.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDg-YmnNehm3KB0BpytkUJg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, but once you go beyond the basics, good information is hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search for ‚ÄúHow do I do X? on iOS‚Äù you will likely find dozens or hundreds of hits, including numerous tutorials, open source libraries, and Stack Overflow questions. Conversely, you will be lucky to find one or two resources for the query ‚ÄúHow do I do X? on macOS‚Äù (or OS X).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is understandable, because iOS is such a huge platform, but it is also quite frustrating, at least to a solo developer like me. If Apple creates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps&quot;&gt;a new framework&lt;/a&gt; or shim layer to let us use iOS frameworks on macOS, I think it would make making Mac apps a lot easier for predominantly iOS-oriented developers like me..&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1Blocker X</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;a href=&quot;https://1blocker.com/&quot;&gt;1Blocker X&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/reviews/1blocker-x-for-ios-review/&quot;&gt;this review from John Voorhies on MacStores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first thing you will notice when you set up 1Blocker X on an iOS device is its 7 toggles in Safari‚Äôs Content Blocker section of the Settings app. It‚Äôs a bit of a head-scratcher at first until you realize that this is what allows 1Blocker X to expand beyond the confines of its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You see, iOS limits the number of blocking rules that can be implemented by an app to 50,000. That‚Äôs a lot of rules, but sadly not enough given the amount of junk on the Internet these days. As a result, it‚Äôs a limit that 1Blocker began to run into not long after it launched in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Finding a way around that hard limit required a rewrite of 1Blocker from the ground up. The result is 1Blocker X, an app with around three times as many blocking rules, room to grow, and enhanced flexibility for applying those rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think I really needed to replace the content blocker I had been using, but it hadn‚Äôt been updated in a really long time, so I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs blocking rules are up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the work these things do is invisilble. It‚Äôs easy to see if ads are blocked, of course, but not so with trackers and malware, which I care more about. At home I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; block ads at the DNS level using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt;, running on an old Raspberry Pi. I heartily recommend setting up a Pi-hole (it‚Äôs easy; there are tutorials to follow). I miss having it when I‚Äôm out of the house, which is why a content blocker is helpful, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, 1Blocker X has been working just fine. I‚Äôve noticed no decrease in speed from Safari, despite the crazy amount of blocking rules I have enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AirPods batteries drain much faster on phone calls</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought my AirPods batteries were already aging out of their useful life span, due to quick draining on numerous hour long phone calls today and last week. It turns out, talk time is only ‚Äúup to 2 hours‚Äù, while listening time (my main use case) is 2 1/2 times that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mmef2am/a/airpods&quot;&gt;Per Apple&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AirPods (single charge): Up to 5 hours listening time,(2) Up to 2 hours talk time(5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So‚Ä¶phew! I‚Äôm more worried about having to replace them after less than two years due to a battery issue than about shorter battery life on calls.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Git Tower vs. Atlassian SourceTree</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am enjoying using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.git-tower.com/mac/&quot;&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; over Atlassian SourceTree. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sourcetreeapp.com&quot;&gt;SourceTree&lt;/a&gt; has many, many features, and is free to use, but it has some puzzling bugs that never seem to get fixed. For example, it never deletes branches via Git Flow, no matter how many times I try to reconfigure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tower is faster, works better, and has a clean UI that fits in on the Mac very well. When I emailed Tower support about something, they responded almost instantly. That sold it for me. When the Tower 3 beta expires, I will be purchasing a license.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Coding on my late 2013 15‚Äù MacBook Pro while watching MLB.TV at 60 FPS on the biggest TV in the house is a quite relaxing combo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;üéµ Taking a trip down memory lane with Guster‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/keep-it-together/1586602&quot;&gt;Keep It Together&lt;/a&gt; this evening, on my MacBook Pro and Oppo PM-3‚Äôs üéß. Their records are cleanly produced, tightly written, and tastefully played. When I saw them &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;, though, they absolutely shredded their way through their songs. They were freaking amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

It (the last chapter and epilogue especially) has overwhelmed me with a sense of love and sadness, which is why it took me so long to read their whole thing. The book is a monumental achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am grateful that the grounds crew I hired cleaned up my yard today. The constant noise from their machines is really driving me nuts, though. They are at a house across the street now, so it has been seven hours of power tool noise for me today.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I must be perverse or something, but one of my favorite apps on iOS is Apple‚Äôs Mail app. I tried several alternatives over the years, but Mail caught up to what I need from an email client a few years ago. I like how clean and simple it is, and rely on its unified inbox feature.&lt;/p&gt;

If they provide Swift syntax highlighting in code blocks, I can finally use it for a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; developer‚Äôs log.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a big Apple software update day today! iOS 11.3 and Xcode 9.3 &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; were released. I hope the new Xcode works out more of the Swift-related kinks. Xcode 9.2 still can‚Äôt jump to many of my method definitions, and I‚Äôve never understood why.&lt;/p&gt;
