        <title>Two of the best platformers I've played on iOS are getting their due today from Apple</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Apple‚Äôs US App Store is highlighting two great games that are among the best on the platform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1356375657&quot;&gt;Game of the Day: Goblin Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Goblin Sword plays like a AAA title from the 16-bit days, and has great play control, difficulty, and variety. It‚Äôs fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1369365671&quot;&gt;Games Are Art: The Beauty of Oddmar&lt;/a&gt;. I learned about Oddmar from someone else on micro.blog, and have only played through a handful of levels. The play controls are unique and well suited for the iPhone, and the graphics and sound are amazing. It‚Äôs a fun and funny game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Remote login Inception</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At work, our clients are far more interested in information security than they used to be. That‚Äôs great, and I applaud them for it. Of course, as a user of their systems, there is a trade-off in terms of convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, logging into remote systems seems like entering a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream‚Äîa la &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of merely using Remote Desktop to log into systems with a single username/password, we now follow in-depth login procedures using virtualization software, RSA tokens that generate unique, one-time passwords, Remote Desktop logins, and systems logins.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who cares about Apple earnings reports?</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do Windows fans care about Microsoft‚Äôs earnings? Do Android fans care about Google‚Äôs? I wonder if the main reason Apple fans (non-investors) &lt;a href=&quot;https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/05/apple-quarterly-results-charts-live-tweets/&quot;&gt;cheer on Apple‚Äôs good earnings reports&lt;/a&gt; is that Apple almost went out of business in the 1990s. Unless the company is going out of business, or if you have tied a lot of your money up with them somehow, who cares about its quarterly earnings report?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üìö Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I completed reading &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One&quot;&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322&quot;&gt;episode of the ‚ÄúTriangulation‚Äù podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir&lt;/a&gt;, who enthusiastically recommended the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as ‚Äúthe reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games‚Äù. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The best part of working from home is the ability to take a nice walk after lunch. Spring weather was finally here at lunchtime, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Summer temperatures will follow by dinner time and last for the foreseeable future. So, that was spring!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I quit my iPhone for a basic Nokia and it was hard but worth it</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1264704/at-first-life-without-a-smartphone-was-terrifying-then-it-was-beautiful/&quot;&gt;This article on Quartz about limiting smartphone use&lt;/a&gt; is both sublime and ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to be present. Is that so much to ask for? Is that so odd to crave in this day and age?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Maybe you‚Äôre reading this thinking I‚Äôm taking it too far and being ridiculous. That it‚Äôs just a smartphone, people check them all the time and that‚Äôs just the way it is and I should get over it and get used to it. But being on it most of my free time feels wrong on every level. I don‚Äôt want to get used to it anymore. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to reduce the amount of time I spend looking at this damn screen instead of being with my own thoughts. It shouldn‚Äôt be this challenging. But it is. And that says tons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I wanted to do the same thing this author does‚Äîdowngrade from smartphone to dumbphone‚Äîbut to save money rather than to improve my contact with the outside world. My plan was to replace the smartphone with an iPad Mini, which I would use only on WiFi. Back then I shuttled every article I read from my RSS app (Reeder) to my read-it-later app (Pocket) and cached them offline, so I would rarely be without an offline time waster, to fill in those dull times in waiting rooms or on trains. I didn‚Äôt go through with the plan, though. I got caught up in smartphone fever along with everyone else in my office. It was an exciting time in the development of that technology‚Äîmuch more exciting than today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is interesting and admirable to try to limit your smartphone use, and it is fun to read about someone‚Äôs experience with it. I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; think that this essay is the sort of thing my grandchildren will read in history class, perhaps on the whatever slab of glass and silicon they carry, and laugh at how silly we were to distrust the most transformative technology of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30&quot;&gt;The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things‚Äîand to try old things again. In that spirit, we‚Äôre launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It‚Äôll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker puzzle is a &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I‚Äôm not a strong player), but I‚Äôm happy there‚Äôs another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prolific Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo departs KGI Securities, likely to focus on companies other than Apple</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi/&quot;&gt;Kuo‚Äôs departure&lt;/a&gt; comes hot off the heels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/13/apple-memo-on-leaks-leaks/&quot;&gt;Apple‚Äôs recent ‚Äúleaked‚Äù memo&lt;/a&gt; about leaking that threatened the leaky leaders who leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple‚Äôs recent memo and strong stance against leaks ‚Äî supply chain or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn‚Äôt mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors,  they don‚Äôt really benefit Apple fans that much.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Om Malik's Shinola Canfield headphone review</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Om Malik wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2018/04/29/shinolas-canfield-headphones/&quot;&gt;a thoughtful review&lt;/a&gt; of a rather high end headphone, the Shinola Canfield. He includes his philosophy on what makes good headphones, and states that you can find really good headphones between $200 and $500, which I wholeheartedly agree with. I especially enjoyed learning about which headphones he keeps around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At home, I listen to Focal Clear, probably the best and the most expensive headphones I will ever owned. I have no desire to either upgrade or change these phones. [‚Ä¶]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For conference calls and phone conversations, I use Apple AirPods. They aren‚Äôt my choice for music, but for watching videos on my iPad, they are more than adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For long-haul flights, I have a pair of beat-up Bose headphones that take AA batteries and are as low-tech as Bose can get. They sit in my luggage and will be there until Bose stops making the replacement ear pads. They are not great for music, but on a loud aircraft, they are just a way to mute everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love knowing that he and I have a similar lineup of headphones, and we split our time between them similarly: a top end headphone (except my top end are the Oppo PM-3, which cost a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; less than his Focal Clear); Apple AirPods for phone calls (I use them for calls, podcasts, and TV but almost never for music); and super old, now-crummy Bose for use on airplanes only.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I miss Caesar salad</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681&quot;&gt;our current, worsening outbreak&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country‚Äôs will to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it‚Äôs worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üìö How We Got To Now</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading Steen Johnson‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html&quot;&gt;How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World&lt;/a&gt;. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson‚Äôs writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it‚Äôs a wonderful read to anyone who loves the ‚Äúhistory of ideas course‚Äù way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments‚Äî‚Äúhummingbird effects‚Äù and ‚Äúthe adjacent possible‚Äù‚Äîthat I particularly like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Finland Has Second Thoughts About Giving Free Money to Jobless People</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nyti.ms/2HpHmQE&quot;&gt;Finland is letting its yearlong experiment with Universal Basic Income expire&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out giving out tax money to people with no strings attached isn‚Äôt widely popular. What is interesting to me, a US citizen, is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn a sense,‚Äù said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, ‚ÄúFinland already has basic income.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I support Universal Basic Income. I think it would help the poor and would spur more people, like me, to start their own businesses. Of course, if we in the US had government provided healthcare, education, and job training programs, it might be enough to spur new business creation. I have the talent to start a consultancy, but the responsibility to pay for healthcare and my children‚Äôs education has always made me feel more secure with a normal, salaried position.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amazon is increasing its Prime membership fee</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/amazon-doubles-its-profit---and-hikes-prime-membership-by-20/2018/04/26/31f5a14c-489a-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html?utm_term=.ff2227bbf7cb&quot;&gt;Amazon is increasing the price of Prime membership&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon also said it will hike its Prime membership fee 20 percent to $119 a year for new members beginning May 11. Existing members who renew their Prime memberships will have to pay the new rate beginning June 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perversely, this news is making me want to buy &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; from them, to get a better value on shipping. I bet Amazon is expecting that response from some of their most loyal customers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mac apps are harder than iOS apps</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I agree with Matt Ronge‚Äôs article ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/astro-hq/mac-apps-are-harder-than-ios-apps-614338e2e470&quot;&gt;Mac apps are harder than iOS apps&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was surprised when a recent project brought me back to the Mac and I discovered how finicky Cocoa really is. I was particularly shocked because I always remembered Cocoa as a particularly nice set of APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; problem that Mr. Ronge does not mention is that there is very little information available online to help a macOS developer work through anything but the most basic situations. Sure, you can find some tutorials on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/macos&quot;&gt;raywenderlich.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDg-YmnNehm3KB0BpytkUJg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, but once you go beyond the basics, good information is hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search for ‚ÄúHow do I do X? on iOS‚Äù you will likely find dozens or hundreds of hits, including numerous tutorials, open source libraries, and Stack Overflow questions. Conversely, you will be lucky to find one or two resources for the query ‚ÄúHow do I do X? on macOS‚Äù (or OS X).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is understandable, because iOS is such a huge platform, but it is also quite frustrating, at least to a solo developer like me. If Apple creates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps&quot;&gt;a new framework&lt;/a&gt; or shim layer to let us use iOS frameworks on macOS, I think it would make making Mac apps a lot easier for predominantly iOS-oriented developers like me..&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1Blocker X</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;a href=&quot;https://1blocker.com/&quot;&gt;1Blocker X&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/reviews/1blocker-x-for-ios-review/&quot;&gt;this review from John Voorhies on MacStores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first thing you will notice when you set up 1Blocker X on an iOS device is its 7 toggles in Safari‚Äôs Content Blocker section of the Settings app. It‚Äôs a bit of a head-scratcher at first until you realize that this is what allows 1Blocker X to expand beyond the confines of its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You see, iOS limits the number of blocking rules that can be implemented by an app to 50,000. That‚Äôs a lot of rules, but sadly not enough given the amount of junk on the Internet these days. As a result, it‚Äôs a limit that 1Blocker began to run into not long after it launched in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Finding a way around that hard limit required a rewrite of 1Blocker from the ground up. The result is 1Blocker X, an app with around three times as many blocking rules, room to grow, and enhanced flexibility for applying those rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think I really needed to replace the content blocker I had been using, but it hadn‚Äôt been updated in a really long time, so I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs blocking rules are up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the work these things do is invisilble. It‚Äôs easy to see if ads are blocked, of course, but not so with trackers and malware, which I care more about. At home I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; block ads at the DNS level using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt;, running on an old Raspberry Pi. I heartily recommend setting up a Pi-hole (it‚Äôs easy; there are tutorials to follow). I miss having it when I‚Äôm out of the house, which is why a content blocker is helpful, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, 1Blocker X has been working just fine. I‚Äôve noticed no decrease in speed from Safari, despite the crazy amount of blocking rules I have enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AirPods batteries drain much faster on phone calls</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought my AirPods batteries were already aging out of their useful life span, due to quick draining on numerous hour long phone calls today and last week. It turns out, talk time is only ‚Äúup to 2 hours‚Äù, while listening time (my main use case) is 2 1/2 times that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mmef2am/a/airpods&quot;&gt;Per Apple&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AirPods (single charge): Up to 5 hours listening time,(2) Up to 2 hours talk time(5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So‚Ä¶phew! I‚Äôm more worried about having to replace them after less than two years due to a battery issue than about shorter battery life on calls.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Git Tower vs. Atlassian SourceTree</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am enjoying using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.git-tower.com/mac/&quot;&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; over Atlassian SourceTree. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sourcetreeapp.com&quot;&gt;SourceTree&lt;/a&gt; has many, many features, and is free to use, but it has some puzzling bugs that never seem to get fixed. For example, it never deletes branches via Git Flow, no matter how many times I try to reconfigure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tower is faster, works better, and has a clean UI that fits in on the Mac very well. When I emailed Tower support about something, they responded almost instantly. That sold it for me. When the Tower 3 beta expires, I will be purchasing a license.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I must be perverse or something, but one of my favorite apps on iOS is Apple‚Äôs Mail app. I tried several alternatives over the years, but Mail caught up to what I need from an email client a few years ago. I like how clean and simple it is, and rely on its unified inbox feature.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I excitedly signed up for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ulyssesapp.com/beta&quot;&gt;Ulysses 13 beta&lt;/a&gt; today. The feature I am most looking forward to is ‚Äúimproved code blocks with syntax highlighting‚Äù. If they provide Swift syntax highlighting in code blocks, I can finally use it for a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; developer‚Äôs log.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I deactivated by Facebook account today. I can‚Äôt muster up the gumption to delete it, and don‚Äôt know why. But it‚Äôs a start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm trying to catch up to current Red Sox games on MLB At Bat. I‚Äôm still a few days behind. It‚Äôs a losing battle every baseball season, because the games are so long.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The spring cleanup landscaping quotes I got this week have a range of $1,400 for the same work. It really pays to shop around, I guess.  Fortunately, my current lawnmowing company put in the lowest quote and can do the work the soonest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My current background task, while I work, is secure erasing a bunch of old, small, unneeded hard drives, to prepare them for recycling. I wish I had encrypted them, to avoid all the wait time ahead of me, but that wasn‚Äôt really an option back when I used them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can program on your hobby projects after work, but sometimes you have to clean house. April is a clean-house kind of month for me.&lt;/p&gt;
