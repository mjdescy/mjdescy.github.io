        <description>&lt;p&gt;A git commit somehow disappeared, eradicating all my app code and obliterating at least one evening’s worth of work. I cracked open a Guinness, restored a backup from Arq, recovered about 80% of my work, and re-did the rest. I’m happy I didn’t lose my cool.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found a headphone case whose brand name really gets at my peculiar affliction.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/media/hbo-att-merger.html&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, I predict that HBO is going to start to get &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; worse under its new ownership (AT&amp;amp;T). I hope I am wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Salsas at my family’s favorite Mexican restaurant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Queso: not hot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Verde: not hot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ranchero: not hot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guajillo: not hot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arbol: &lt;em&gt;way too hot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple’s App Review rejected my new app, primarily because its name had the word “free” in it. While that’s not the end of the world, it will delay the app’s release for at least a couple days, as I figure out a new name and the best way to handle everything in App Store Connect.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thomasfinch.me/iosicon/&quot;&gt;Thomas Finch’s iOS 7+ Icon Generator&lt;/a&gt; is a nice, little utility. It takes a square app icon and masks it to match the rounded corner shape of modern iOS icons.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/movies/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review-marvel-paul-rudd.html&quot;&gt;a favorable review of “Ant-Man and the Wasp”&lt;/a&gt;. I’m apt to see it because I enjoy the Marvel Universe movies and because I’ve seen the commercial for it about 15,000 times during MLB.TV baseball games.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/assembly-art-and-design/id1024210402?mt=8&quot;&gt;Assembly by Pixite&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an easy to use vector drawing app for iOS. Their new icon looks nice, but I will miss their cleverly designed bird icon. Luckily, it’s still on the app’s splash screen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just submitted a new iOS app to the App Store tonight. My fingers are crossed when it comes to the approval process. Hopefully nothing trips it up or anything. More details to come.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;These Master &amp;amp; Dynamic MH40 headphones are something special: premium materials, crystal clear sound, wide soundstage, and a unique bump in the bass range that I like more than I thought I would.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My kids love the public library. My family had a nice trip there to get out of the heat today. It’s exciting now that my daughter is learning how to read. My son has enjoyed thumbing through books since he could sit up. Meanwhile, I only read on my iPad these days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I would subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;https://birchtree.me/blog/apple-entertainment-pricing-and-feature-speculation/&quot;&gt;Apple Music + News + TV for $149/year&lt;/a&gt; (or a little more for a family plan), but I’m a sucker for Apple products and services anyway. I would be a Texture subscriber &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; if their app experience wasn’t (in my opinion) terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>As Kennedy Retires, the Supreme Court’s Attack on Labor Unions Is a Sign of Things to Come</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;No kidding, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/as-kennedy-retires-the-supreme-courts-attack-on-labor-unions-is-a-sign-of-things-to-come&quot;&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;, no kidding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For years, conservatives complained about activist liberal judges making it up as they went along. Today, they are the activists. Under the guise of “originalism,” they are rewriting the nation’s laws to further the reactionary political agenda of the Republican Party and its biggest donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the scare quotes around “originalism”. It, like all the other -ism words we throw around—conservatism, liberalism, socialism—
is completely devoid of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have not been blogging as much recently because I have been disturbed so much by the onslaught of surprising and disturbing headlines here in the US.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My clever, well-written new app currently does everything it’s supposed to do…except the main thing it’s supposed to do. I guess I’ve got some debugging and re-engineering to do!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tower 3.0's release and new pricing model</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been beta testing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.git-tower.com&quot;&gt;Tower 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very nice Git GUI client, for the past few months. The team behind it have just announced that the version 3.0 is complete. I was ready last week to purchase the software at its old price, which would be a one-time purchase of $79, but Tower has also announced that it is moving to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.git-tower.com/pricing&quot;&gt;subscription pricing&lt;/a&gt; for version 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching from paid-up-front to subscription-based is somewhat controversial. I, for one, am all for software subscriptions, so I support the developers’ decision. However, their decision has signaled that Tower is not for me. Even with the generous 50% discount for the first year that they have offered me, as a beta tester, the developers have priced me out of their product. For a professional, making a living from their software,  the subscription cost for an important workplace tool is merely a drop in the bucket. But for me, a hobbyist developer who charges for my apps to cover my costs, I don’t make nearly enough money from my apps to justify paying more than a couple dollars per month for a Git client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git’s command line tools and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sourcetreeapp.com&quot;&gt;Atlassian’s SourceTree&lt;/a&gt; client are free to use. I will be back to using SourceTree—which which is free, full-featured, but not as well polished as Tower—shortly. Thanks to the Tower team for allowing me to beta test their software. I wish them the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking of trading in my V-Moda Crossfade 2’s plus $100 to upgrade to thier &lt;a href=&quot;https://v-moda.com/products/crossfade2-wireless-codex&quot;&gt;Codex edition&lt;/a&gt;, which are the same headphones plus AAC and aptX support over Bluetooth. The better codecs will make them useful longer, like when the Lightning port goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>General Electric Dropped from Dow</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/business/dealbook/general-electric-dow-jones.html&quot;&gt;It’s the end of an era.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t even get me started as to the idiocy of following a price-weighted stock index in the age of computers, but being part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average&quot;&gt;DJIA&lt;/a&gt; is a huge badge of honor that G.E. has now lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company’s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company’s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent decline of G.E. has been shocking to me. When I was at business school in Connecticut, G.E. was, rightly, considered a giant of industry and of financial services. Now it appears to be a lumbering giant, a lion in winter. I wonder what it will take to turn the company around.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apple Didn't Kill Appkit...</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://subfurther.com/blog/2018/06/17/apple-didnt-kill-appkit-millenials-did/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, quite rightly, made me feel bad about not pushing through the troubles I had porting SwiftoDo to the Mac—a project I haven’t touched in over a year now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is it really that hard to share a codebase between Mac and iOS? I just sent off the “other platforms” chapter of Xcode Treasures, and one of the sections is about creating multi-platform projects. The book shows how to add tvOS to an iOS project from earlier in the book, but the idea is the same regardless of which platforms you support: portion off the code you can into cross-platform frameworks, ideally leaving only platform-specific UI code in each platform’s targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I modularized a lot of my code to allow it to happen someday, but found out that it would require a lot of work to ramp up my AppKit skills. All the data manipulation code is in a well-contained library. That’s just a small part of the app, though. The features are all in UI code, and porting it to AppKit resembles a 90% rewrite of my app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was doing development professionally, I would have done it. But as a hobbyist, it’s hard to want to dive deep into AppKit when there are a million things to create or fix on iOS, which feels like Apple’s future platform anyway. Maybe I’m lazy, and maybe Apple is going to help me out with UIKit on the Mac twelve months from now.&lt;/p&gt;

I have re-discovered just how hard it can be to write &lt;em&gt;memory-constrained&lt;/em&gt; algorithms. Modern processor speed and memory limits have spoiled me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering, as one of my domain names is set to auto-renew, whether domain names increase or decrease in cost over time. I used to register my domain names for ten year periods, to lock in the price, but now I’m not so sure if it is worth it. Prices seem pretty consistent now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning the Core Data Framework</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have taken it upon myself to finally teach myself &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html?utm_source=iosstash.io&quot;&gt;Core Data&lt;/a&gt;. I had avoided it for years, due to its complexity and because it was &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; for my projects. I decided to learn it to challenge myself and to level up a bit as an iOS developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning it reminds me of learning Objective C and Cocoa years ago. Core Data presents itself as a daunting hierarchy of NS-prefixed classes, with lots of layers and moving parts, but it (kind of) makes sense after a long period of study. It’s starting to make sense to me now, though I have barely scratched the surface of its functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been writing and rewriting and never finishing the same sample app for the past week. Of course, I made it difficult for myself by requiring it to have an App Group, and for the Core Data stack to be defined in its own Framework. I figured out how to do so a couple days ago, and then, this morning, stumbled on the exact same process recommended in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/224&quot;&gt;Apple’s WWDC 2018 Core Data Best Practices video &lt;/a&gt;. At least I know I got part of my Core Data stack set up the right way!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apple hardware woes</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As much as I love Apple hardware, I’ve got a bunch of Apple hardware problems all of the sudden:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AirPod battery life has dropped to less than an hour for phone calls. My AirPods are about 18 months old.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bad backlight bleed developed on the bottom edge of my iPad Pro. Dark backgrounds obscure it, but light backgrounds don’t. I will see tomorrow if they will fix it under warranty. My iPad Pro is 11 months old.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bright spot developed in the bottom right corner of my iPhone 7 Plus. You can only see it when that section of the screen is displaying white. I’ll ask about it at the Genius Bar tomorrow. My iPhone is almost 20 months old. Luckily, it’s still covered by AppleCare+.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My 2013 MacBook Pro started dropping my USB trackball upon or after going to sleep. I have to unplug and replug it to make it work again. Research has shown me that this sort of thing is one of those unknown bugs. I hope it doesn’t mean my logic board is going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all minor quibbles, but they are all about rather expensive hardware. I think I’m going to start buying AppleCare+ from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
