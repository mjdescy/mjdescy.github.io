        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am disappointed in the current slate of Broadway musicals. I thought last year was particularly weak, but this year is worse. I am only an infrequent Broadway theater goer, do to the ticket prices, but I listen to a lot of cast recordings. Nothing is grabbing my attention now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do any Micro.bloggers have any suggestions for a good iOS guided meditation app for beginners? There are so many to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm happy that the Accidental Tech Podcast hosts got invited to the Apple Mac and iPad event, and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/marco&quot;&gt;@marco&lt;/a&gt; got a couple of review units, too. I have enjoyed ATP‚Äôs last two episodes all the more because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;üéµ I‚Äôm listening to a bunch of different versions of what is probably the greatest Bossa nova song ever: ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/%C3%A1guas-de-marco/263743484?i=263743529&quot;&gt;Aguas de Marco&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù/‚Äù&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-waters-of-march/152819588?i=152819611&quot;&gt;Waters of March&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Chrome (on Windows 10) does not take &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; long to load, but it takes long enough for me to forget why I launched it by the time it opens.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My employer is changing its email retention policy to discourage employees from keeping email &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;, and focusing on its use as a communication tool rather than an historical archive. I have been waiting for 20 years for such a thing to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a ‚Äúfast‚Äù lens for my micro 4/3 camera to take pictures of my kids indoors, where the light is not good. I have gotten some great shots, but I have concluded, after about a month of shooting, that what I really need is a TTL flash that I can bounce off the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have not been looking at polls, because I don‚Äôt want to drive myself crazy, but I am really nervous about voter turnout for next week‚Äôs midterm election. I have a vague dread that Democrats will, once again, not vote in large enough numbers to help un-f*** this country.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a dream last night that the Dodgers scored 5 runs in the top of the 9th and won the game, even though I knew the outcome of the game before I went to sleep. üò±&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just discovered that you can ask Siri to ‚Äúshow me pictures of X‚Äù. It has been a great way to quickly get to all my photos of my various family members.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm debating voting by mail for the next election and all subsequent ones (that‚Äôs how the enrollment form works in my area). The convenience would be beneficial, but we would miss out on bringing our kids to the polls, which I think helps them learn that it is important to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading John Gruber‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/the_iphone_xr&quot;&gt;iPhone XR review&lt;/a&gt; this morning. I am thinking of waiting for the initial buying rush to wear off, and taking my wife to the store to buy her one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been dithering on the issue for a couple weeks, I finally pulled the trigger and ordered a Nintendo Switch. I ordered Breath of the Wild as my initial game, and hope to have some escapist fun with it soon. I plan to use it almost entirely as a portable system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am thrilled that the Red Sox have made it to the World Series. I am a little dismayed, however, that I‚Äôm too tired late at night to watch the end of these slow-moving playoff games. (I guess I‚Äôm old now.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An update on the new Chromebook</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished setting up my daughter‚Äôs new Chromebook. I bought her an Asus C302C. It‚Äôs a nice machine‚Äî66% of a MacBook Air for 50% of the cost, plus a touchscreen and 180¬∫ hinge for tablet mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy to find out that setup was a snap, which I should have expected. Luckily for me, Chrome OS still resembles the windowed version I left behind years ago, so it is familiar enough for me to deal with when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have to figure out how to enable the hilariously named ‚ÄúAustralian scrolling‚Äù feature on the touchpad, though. I guess the name ‚Äúnatural scroll direction‚Äù was taken. As a Mac user, I was surprised that it was not the default. I can‚Äôt even remember what my Windows machines default to, though. Maybe natural scrolling is mainly an Apple thing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that Drafts has a preview for the Mac, I wonder if it is time for me to try to migrate from Ulysses to Drafts for all my writing. I love both apps, and even use Ulysses to store all my writing now, but don‚Äôt really want to pay for both subscriptions every year. I probably write more in Drafts than Ulysses day-to-day, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got a new Apple Watch Series 4. I‚Äôm still getting used to the larger screen and I am a little disappointed that some complications are not compatible with the new Infograph watch faces. I‚Äôm hoping third party apps work better than they did on Series 0 &amp;amp; Series 1.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A new Chromebook</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just ordered a new Chromebook for my daughter, based on Wirecutter‚Äôs recommendation. It was a lot more expensive than I thought Chromebooks sold for, but I bought a decently-speced one for the battery life, screen, and RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure what to expect when I have to set it up. I am not even sure what a Chromebook &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; anymore, now that ChromeOS runs Android apps. I was an owner/user of the original Cr-48 (the prototype Chromebook from Google). I loved CromeOS when it was just a browser, but Google started to loose me when they adding windowing. Now that the Play Store is available, it just feels like another Windows-type platform. I would prefer the ‚Äújust a browser‚Äù version I had before. Perhaps I will soon learn, once the Chromebook arrives, that it still can be run that way. I have been away from it for too long at this point to know.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Without really planning to, I realized that, over time, I have reduced the number of podcasts I subscribe to by about 60%, and have slowed the playback speed from 1.2x or 1.1x to 1.0x (with smart speed enabled). I will retcon this observation into my overall plan to reduce information overload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DuckDuckGo is actually pretty great</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Switching my default search engine from Google to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; this week has been painless. Search results are great (I‚Äôm missing nothing by not using Google), and I like it a lot better than Bing. It feels a lot like Google used to, back when Google was focused on searching‚Äîyou know‚Äî&lt;em&gt;the web&lt;/em&gt;, rather than Google‚Äôs own interpretation of the web. You can also customize its look and feel, and even hide its own ads, which is &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt;. So far, I‚Äôm very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is the Aeneid a Celebration of Empire‚Äîor a Critique?</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/is-the-aeneid-a-celebration-of-empire-or-a-critique&quot;&gt;Daniel Mendelsohn article in The New Yorker about &lt;em&gt;The Aeneid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to be engaging and fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is the Aeneid about? It is about a tiny band of outcasts, the survivors of a terrible persecution. It is about how these survivors‚Äîclinging to a divine assurance that an unknown and faraway land will become their new home‚Äîarduously cross the seas, determined to refashion themselves as a new people, a nation of victors rather than victims. It is about how, when they finally get there, they find their new homeland inhabited by locals who have no intention of making way for them. It is about how this geopolitical tragedy generates new wars, wars that will, in turn, trigger further conflicts: bella horrida bella. It is about how such conflicts leave those involved in them morally unrecognizable, even to themselves. This is a story that both the Old and the New Worlds know too well; and Virgil was the first to tell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disagree with the last sentence of the quote I pulled. The story the author describes is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the story of the Israelites in the Old Testament, which predates Virgil, though I‚Äôm not sure if Virgil could have known the stories. I‚Äôm sure the author intended us to think of that connection, though, based on how he wrote the passage. Consider me a little puzzled by this, but grateful to have read the article.&lt;/p&gt;
