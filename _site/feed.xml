        <description>&lt;p&gt;I rewatched “Avengers: Age of Infinity” and my loved it. I actually liked it better the second time. If 20-year-old me knew that nearly-40-year-old me would prefer comic book movies to nearly everything else…I don’t think we would be friends.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the big trip up north in the car. It’s a 5-hour trek that somehow takes my family 12 hours or so each year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve got only 5 days until vacation. Hopefully I can shift gears from programming and data work for my day job back to writing and coding for my hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My work day started off far more slowly than expected. Therefore, I’m coding—maybe all day—for my “number 3” project.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I took my (old) Sony RX 100 camera to the splash park to take pictures of the kids and got dozens of great shots. My wife and I looked back at our kids’ baby pictures a little, after looking through today’s photos, and had a great time doing so tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been seriously considering holding on to my iPhone 7 Plus for a third year. I just got a new screen and a new battery, It looks almost brand new, I still like the camera, I never complain about it being slow, and iOS 12 promises to improve performance when I upgrade to it. I feel the same way about my Series 1 Apple Watch, too, though my desire to upgrade it to whatever model Apple releases next is still a lot higher.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the day coding an Access app for work. I’m coding VBA now almost like it’s a proper object-oriented language: lots of tiny classes that do one thing only, basically no repeated code segments, use of design patterns wherever possible, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing my latest iOS app: Simple Call Blocker</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecallblockerapp.com&quot;&gt;Simple Call Blocker&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;free app&lt;/a&gt; for blocking unwanted calls on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides a basic way to block lots of numbers via a CallKit directory extension–which is great for blocking neighbor spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike almost every other call blocker out there, mine is completely free and doesn’t need access to your contacts to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Try it out.&lt;/a&gt; It’s free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more, there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecallblockerapp.com&quot;&gt;website with screenshots and a FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/introducing-simple-call-blocker/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; describing my motivation for writing it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I find myself shifting my listening time away from podcasts and more toward music lately</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started listening to podcasts in 2008. I think, now, I am, for the first time, burnt out on the medium. I listen to a lot of podcasts while I work, but lately I’ve found I can barely remember what the episodes were about shortly after they finish. I think I am tuning them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am paring back my subscriptions down—way down—to a few favorites and listening to more music instead. It’s symmetrical to how I got into podcast listening: I was burnt out on listening to music all day long, and became uninterested in music for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;🎵 I’m back to my wired OPPO PM-3 &amp;amp; HA-2 SE headphones stack today, listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/foreverland-deluxe-version/1114549349&quot;&gt;Foreverland&lt;/a&gt;, by The Divine Comedy. It’s an album that slipped by me in 2016. I used to love The Divine Comedy in the late 1990s, and still take &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/casanova/162993522&quot;&gt;Casanova&lt;/a&gt; for a spin every six months or so.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trial runs for fascism are in full flow</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/fintan-o-toole-trial-runs-for-fascism-are-in-full-flow-1.3543375&quot;&gt;This article by Fintan O’Toole&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Irish Times&lt;/em&gt; is a few weeks old now, but I keep thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fascism doesn’t arise suddenly in an existing democracy. It is not easy to get people to give up their ideas of freedom and civility. You have to do trial runs that, if they are done well, serve two purposes. They get people used to something they may initially recoil from; and they allow you to refine and calibrate. This is what is happening now and we would be fools not to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. O’Toole lays out a simple and convincing argument outlining ideas that I have been mulling over in my head, but not writing much about, since Trump’s election on November 8, 2016. What has happened—at an accelerating pace, I think, since last year—is that the bounds of what is considered &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; have been stretched so far into what was previously &lt;em&gt;outrageous&lt;/em&gt; that I fear there is no going back. If Trump and the Republican Party are proving that the U.S. president is above the law, and that much of what governed the government was merely tradition, which is disposable for political expediency, then what, if anything, will constrain the power and the actions of future U.S. presidents?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m super pleased listening to these V-Moda Crossfade 2 Codex Edition headphones all day at work, over Bluetooth. (Wireless use is pretty rare for me.) Great sound. Great isolation. The top of my head is a little sore from the headband, though. (They are kind of heavy.) 🎧&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I checked out the new MacBook Pros at the Apple Store. The new keyboard looks (feels) like a winner to me. It is quieter, and there’s a good chance it won’t have the same reliability problem as the prior generation. I would prefer a 15” one without the TouchBar, though, but don’t plan to buy one until my 2015 rMBP breaks or is no longer supported.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our appointment for family photos at the park got canceled today due to heavy rain. We ended up shopping and eating pancakes instead. Not a bad trade-off for the day, but I would have liked to have the photos later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I both love and hate articles like “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/opinion/new-york-yankees-evil.html&quot;&gt;The New York Yankees Are a Moral Abomination&lt;/a&gt;”. Handwringing, declinist arguments about baseball are almost as old as baseball itself. “Baseball is in decline” is part of its brand—part that needs to go away, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseball is awesome. The players are very skillful, play a game that doesn’t involve hurting each other, and legitimately appear to be enjoying themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started replaying Bastion on my IPad Pro tonight. I bought it years ago and never finished it. I’m using a controller and headphones this time around, which improve the experience. I’m better at combat than I used to be, but a lot worse at the proving grounds challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If I was smart, I would save $100/month for a new MacBook every 4 years or so. I am not smart.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The App Store gods are not smiling on me this week. My new app got rejected again. Now things are screwed up in a way I cannot fix. Hopefully it will all work out eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A git commit somehow disappeared, eradicating all my app code and obliterating at least one evening’s worth of work. I cracked open a Guinness, restored a backup from Arq, recovered about 80% of my work, and re-did the rest. I’m happy I didn’t lose my cool.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope I am wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple’s App Review rejected my new app, primarily because its name had the word “free” in it. While that’s not the end of the world, it will delay the app’s release for at least a couple days, as I figure out a new name and the best way to handle everything in App Store Connect.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thomasfinch.me/iosicon/&quot;&gt;Thomas Finch’s iOS 7+ Icon Generator&lt;/a&gt; is a nice, little utility. It takes a square app icon and masks it to match the rounded corner shape of modern iOS icons.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/assembly-art-and-design/id1024210402?mt=8&quot;&gt;Assembly by Pixite&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an easy to use vector drawing app for iOS. Their new icon looks nice, but I will miss their cleverly designed bird icon. Luckily, it’s still on the app’s splash screen.&lt;/p&gt;
