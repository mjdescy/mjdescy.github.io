        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am digging my old, blue, knockoff Apple Watch Sport Band again. I kind of wish I bought the real, fluoroelastomer band, though, because the silicone feels a little sticky and looks a little shiny.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a muggy day in New Jersey, which is a great excuse to go to the beach. Plus there are &lt;em&gt;rides&lt;/em&gt; on the boardwalk for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally ‚Äúretired‚Äù my 9-year-old AeroPress today, in favor of a new one. The plunger end on the old one wore down to the point where it was causing problems. It will be nice to have a spare cap and coffee measuring scoop going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs silly, but I am a little disappointed that AirPlay 2 will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be available on both Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen and B&amp;amp;O PLAY speakers until sometime during August or September 2018. I want multi room streaming with my BeoPlay M3 and my Apple TV &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This VBA class helps you work with temporary tables in Access VBA projects: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/mjdescy/621e03e8d2dd83984d83ec83ca05c6fc&quot;&gt;DAOTemporaryTableController.cls&lt;/a&gt;. You may need to do so if you want to join using a subquery as criteria, which Access does not allow.&lt;/p&gt;

It amazes me that we ship recyclables around the world for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I unfollowed about 275 accounts on Twitter this afternoon. My Twitter feed had started to resemble a junk drawer to me. One thing I noticed is that 90% of the accounts I followed had not posted anything in months. (Let‚Äôs not even talk about how many bots are following &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It looks like Essential is going away</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/andy-rubin-s-phone-maker-essential-is-said-to-consider-sale&quot;&gt;Android Creator Puts Essential Up for Sale, Cancels Next Phone - Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Current discussions are focused on a sale of the entire company, including its patent portfolio, hardware products like the original smartphone, an upcoming smart home device and a camera attachment for the phone, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got an Essential Phone in its release date, and was optimistic that the company would succeed. It looks like it hasn‚Äôt. Their first phone &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a bad camera experience (hardware and software-wise), which probably prevented any chance of success from the start. The Pixel and the Galaxy phones put it to shame. Plus, it must be next to impossible to make money selling Android phones. It‚Äôs not a business I would want to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üéµ First listen: Mean Girls (Original Broadway Cast)</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mean-girls-original-broadway-cast-recording/1372106911&quot;&gt;Mean Girls (Original Broadway Cast)&lt;/a&gt; is up for the Tony for best musical this year, and I think it has a legitimate shot. While this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a weak year for the American musical, the music of ‚ÄúMean Girls‚Äù is fun and catchy, and the lyrics are funny and full of wordplay. The singing and production of the cast album are top notch, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it. The high school setting and girl-centric plot, though not the music, remind me a lot of ‚ÄúBring It On‚Äù, which is another musical that has a fantastic cast album and works a lot better than you would think. I don‚Äôt know if this show will be a hit on Broadway, but I predict a long life on high school drama club stages in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; testing and fixing things in my dev build of SwiftoDo 2.12.0. It feels weird to have gone so long without issuing a release. I hope to get everything done next week. I have a very full weekend of family activities ahead of me, though, so I can‚Äôt do much till Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üéµ Carry On</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On this bad and sad news day, remember:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre lost and alone&lt;br /&gt;
Or you‚Äôre sinking like a stone&lt;br /&gt;
Carry on&lt;br /&gt;
May your past be the sound&lt;br /&gt;
Of your feed upon the ground and&lt;br /&gt;
Carry on&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄòCause we are, we are shining stars&lt;br /&gt;
We are invincible&lt;br /&gt;
We are who we are&lt;br /&gt;
On our darkest day&lt;br /&gt;
When we‚Äôre miles away&lt;br /&gt;
So we‚Äôll come, we will find our way home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun.‚Äôs ‚ÄúCarry On‚Äù works well, and feels quite different, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/carry-on-feat-shannon-purser-rise-cast-version/1382637611?i=1382638029&quot;&gt;this cover version by the cast of ‚ÄúRise‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üéµ Frozen: The Broadway Musical</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Listening to the cast recording of ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/frozen-broadway-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1378411252&quot;&gt;Frozen: The Broadway Musical&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù for the first time is a bit surreal for me.  Compared to the movie, there are new songs, lyrics changes in existing songs, and, of course, different singers. I don‚Äôt think any of the changes are for the better. It‚Äôs hard to say for sure, though, because, as a parent of a little girl, I‚Äôve heard the movie and the movie soundtrack about 1,000 times already, and it‚Äôs burned into my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I think I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; a Nintendo Switch, I‚Äôm trying to make due for now with what I already have‚Äîan iPad Pro and a SteelSeries Nimbus controller. I‚Äôm not sure I even want to commit the &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to gaming, but I am curious about the latest Mario and Zelda games.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google's music and video streaming strategy is a mess</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/17/google-play-youtube-music-premium-strategy/&quot;&gt;Engadget has it right&lt;/a&gt;. I have no idea what Google audio/video service I should ever consider subscribing to, and because music is tied in there, they don‚Äôt offer what I want (ad-free YouTube) at price that is reasonable to me. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter, because Google will just fold it and create an alternative service, with a different name, price, and product mix, in a couple years anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I rely on Google Search, and as much as I use, indifferently, Gmail, I just don‚Äôt understand Google as a company. Their central strategy appears to be ‚Äúno strategy‚Äù. They try stuff out, kill it if it fails, and iterate on what succeeds. This process is fun to watch when the company is a young startup, but is a bit much to bear when they are one of the four pillars of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my kids didn‚Äôt love YouTube, but hate the ads, I wouldn‚Äôt think about subscribing to YouTube Premium (or is it YouTube Red? or is it YouTube Music?) at all. If Google cared about customers like me‚Äîvery light YouTube viewers who would pay a small amount of money to not be interrupted by ads‚ÄîI would send them some money each month.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;cast&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Solo&lt;/em&gt; certainly is  appealing, even if &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/culture/2018/05/solo-the-new-star-wars-movie-reviewed.html&quot;&gt;the movie itself may be largely inconsequential&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>üéµ Frightened Rabbit singer commits suicide üò•</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;(My original title was just an expletive.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44079462&quot;&gt;Body confirmed as missing Frightened Rabbit singer - BBC News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDepression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you‚Äù, it added.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúScott battled bravely with his own issues for many years and we are immensely proud of him for being so open with his struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHis willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm so upset. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; Frightened Rabbit. It was no secret that Scott Hutchison suffered from depression, anxiety, and who knows what else‚Äîit‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;all over&lt;/em&gt; his arch, wry lyrics. Go listen to ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/keep-yourself-warm/917524230?i=917524306&quot;&gt;Keep Yourself Warm&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù to get an idea of what a great singer/songwriter he was.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pure Gold from Pinboard's FAQ</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across this tonight, as I was perusing &lt;a href=&quot;https://pinboard.in/faq/#cjk_search&quot;&gt;Pinboard‚Äôs FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, trying to learn something different about the service that I have been ignoring for the past year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is it true the site admin can see private bookmarks?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yes. I routinely look at raw bookmark data, which includes private bookmarks. Most of the time this means I look at URLs without any identifying context.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I try to avoid looking at private data on people‚Äôs individual pages. However, this is sometimes necessary in order to diagnose and fix bugs in Pinboard, such as search errors, or strange formatting in archived pages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I use the metaphor of a hotel manager. I have a key that opens every room, but I try not to use it without a good reason. &lt;strong&gt;And I can assure everyone that five years of running this site has eliminated any trace of curiosity I might have had about what people bookmark.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Emphasis is my own. ü§£)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Best Trackballs according to Wirecutter</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wirecutter updated its &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-trackballs/?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=RSS%20Feed&quot;&gt;trackballs review&lt;/a&gt; today. Their recommendations are basically unchanged, which is no surprise, because the entire trackball market has been stagnant for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of evolution in trackballs, I am a huge fan of them. I credit swapping my mouse for a trackball with reducing, to almost nothing, repetitive stress injuries from computing. I find trackballs to be more comfortable to use and more precise than both mice and trackpads. I actually have one for each my my machines (Mac and PC), and bring the smaller one with me when I travel for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt quibble with WireCutter‚Äôs top pick, but I disagree with their assessment of my main trackball, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kensington.com/en/ae/4493/k72327eu/slimblade-trackball&quot;&gt;Kensington SlimBlade&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Instead of using a hardware scroll ring as on the Kensington Expert Mouse and Orbit with Scroll Ring, with the Kensington SlimBlade Trackball you have to rotate the ball to scroll, which is tough to do without bouncing the cursor around the screen. The SlimBlade‚Äôs buttons feel hollow compared with the Expert Mouse‚Äôs, and its shiny plastic and metal surfaces attract fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, its buttons could be a little clickier, but rotating the ball to scroll without moving the cursor is actually pretty easy. Unlike the Expert Mouse, the SlimBlade doesn‚Äôt have an unnecessarily steep angle to it, so you can use it comfortably without a wrist rest. And, honestly, saying its ‚Äúsurfaces attract fingerprints‚Äù is just plain stupid. My iPad Pro screen, which is the finest screen in my entire house, ‚Äúattracts fingerprints‚Äù too. I think product reviewers need to strike that quibble off their list.&lt;/p&gt;
