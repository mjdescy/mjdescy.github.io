			"content_html": "<p>I fixed the SwiftoDo chrasher that I griped about this afternoon, and, to future-me’s chagrin, I stayed up late to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Tracking down the problem was tricky, but I eventually discovered that <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIDocument</code>’s <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">revert</code> method was failing because sometimes it was being executed on a closed file. It turns out that I was not interrogating <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIDocument.documentState</code> correctly when checking for “closed” file state. The <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">documentState</code> property is an OptionSet, and has a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">contains</code> method that is more appropriate to use than <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">==</code> for this purpose.</p>\n\n<p>At least, that what I think right now. I’ll test my app out for a day or two and see if the nasty crash bug rears its head again, or moves to a new call site.</p>\n",

Unfortunately, out of nowhere, it started crashing on launch late this morning. Fortunately, I never finished submitting this build to the App Store for review, so it will never reach users. It does mean, however, that I have to debug a tricky treading-related crash before I can release the cool new feature I have been working on.</p>\n",

I thought, for fun, I would start reading one comic book per day, and think that justifies the subscription price. I am enjoying the service, but I have, historically, only read comics in short, intense bursts every couple years, so I’m not sure if I will really stick with it once I read through the series I started. Of course, now I’m hooked on Brian Michael Bendis’s run of <em>All-New X-Men</em>, so I predict I will renew the subscription in some way.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://joe-steel.com/2018-08-20-First-Time-Tooter-Long-Time-Tweeter.html\">This blog post</a> is a great overview of Mastodon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In conversations I’ve had over the past week, it’s become clear that there’s nothing very self-explanatory about Mastodon as a social network, and that in many ways Twitter users are both prepared and unprepared for the experience. There are a lot of things that are similar in concept, but there’s more to it when it comes to how it’s a “service” that can really throw people for a loop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I use Mastodon <em>a little</em>, but don’t really feel strongly one way or another towards the platform. I <em>want</em> to like it more. I was super enthusiastic about its predecessors, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_social\">StatusNet</a> (nee Laconica, now GNU Social), but those failed to gain significant momentum, and became overrun with spam.</p>\n\n<p>Despite whatever is new and exciting about Mastodon’s web UI, open web features, etc., it doesn’t feel that new or exciting to me. It feels like a better StatusNet. I suppose, though, that I care more about writing and posting content, and owning it, than about the ephemeral and chatty aspects of social networking.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I bought my iPad Air 2 almost a year after it was released, only a few months before the first iPad Pro was released. I was a little worried at the time that I would get only a couple years out of it before iOS updates rendered it obsolete. I have been pleasantly surprised that that day has not yet arrived—and, based on how the iOS 12 beta is running, that day will not arrive for at least another year.</p>\n\n<p>Last night, I finally installed the iOS 12 beta on it, and found the new OS to be smooth, stable, and fast. All my apps (even the ones I wrote!) are working just fine. As Apple promised, UI and animation-related things like scrolling are visibly faster and smoother, too.</p>\n\n<p>I plan to install iOS 12 beta on my iPhone 7 Plus in early September, after I complete my next release of <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a>. Based what I’m seeing, performance wise, on my even-older iPad Air 2, I’m looking forward to at least one more year of service from my iPhone 7 Plus, too. (It helps that my phone has a brand new battery and a new screen, thanks to AppleCare Plus.)</p>\n",

Rather than separating the forecast onto multiple pages, we now combine the current conditions, next hour rain forecast, next 24 hours, and next week forecasts into a single scrollable view that lets you quickly get to the part of the forecast you care about. This makes it much easier to scan what will happen in the minutes, hours, and days ahead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dark Sky version 1.0, which was singularly focused on precipitation warnings and maps for your immediate vicinity, was probably my favorite iteration of the app. It wasn’t a full-fledged weather app at the time, but its singular focus was useful for me whenever I wanted to step out of the house or office.</p>\n\n<p>I have been using Weather Line, which uses Dark Sky weather data, almost exclusively for the past couple years, because its information layout was denser and more useful. This update may bring me back to Dark Sky, however. I’m moving it back to my home screen and will give it a go.</p>\n",
