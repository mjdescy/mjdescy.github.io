It feels a lot like Google used to, back when Google was focused on searching‚Äîyou know‚Äî<em>the web</em>, rather than Google‚Äôs own interpretation of the web. You can also customize its look and feel, and even hide its own ads, which is <em>crazy</em>. So far, I‚Äôm very happy.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I found <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/is-the-aeneid-a-celebration-of-empire-or-a-critique\">Daniel Mendelsohn article in The New Yorker about <em>The Aeneid</em></a> to be engaging and fascinating.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the Aeneid about? It is about a tiny band of outcasts, the survivors of a terrible persecution. It is about how these survivors‚Äîclinging to a divine assurance that an unknown and faraway land will become their new home‚Äîarduously cross the seas, determined to refashion themselves as a new people, a nation of victors rather than victims. It is about how, when they finally get there, they find their new homeland inhabited by locals who have no intention of making way for them. It is about how this geopolitical tragedy generates new wars, wars that will, in turn, trigger further conflicts: bella horrida bella. It is about how such conflicts leave those involved in them morally unrecognizable, even to themselves. This is a story that both the Old and the New Worlds know too well; and Virgil was the first to tell it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I disagree with the last sentence of the quote I pulled. The story the author describes is <em>also</em> the story of the Israelites in the Old Testament, which predates Virgil, though I‚Äôm not sure if Virgil could have known the stories. I‚Äôm sure the author intended us to think of that connection, though, based on how he wrote the passage. Consider me a little puzzled by this, but grateful to have read the article.</p>\n",
