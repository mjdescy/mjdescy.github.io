Luckily for me, Chrome OS still resembles the windowed version I left behind years ago, so it is familiar enough for me to deal with when I need to.</p>\n\n<p>I did have to figure out how to enable the hilariously named ‚ÄúAustralian scrolling‚Äù feature on the touchpad, though. I guess the name ‚Äúnatural scroll direction‚Äù was taken. As a Mac user, I was surprised that it was not the default. I can‚Äôt even remember what my Windows machines default to, though.

I am not even sure what a Chromebook <em>is</em> anymore, now that ChromeOS runs Android apps. I was an owner/user of the original Cr-48 (the prototype Chromebook from Google). I loved CromeOS when it was just a browser, but Google started to loose me when they adding windowing. Now that the Play Store is available, it just feels like another Windows-type platform. I would prefer the ‚Äújust a browser‚Äù version I had before. Perhaps I will soon learn, once the Chromebook arrives, that it still can be run that way.

It is about a tiny band of outcasts, the survivors of a terrible persecution. It is about how these survivors‚Äîclinging to a divine assurance that an unknown and faraway land will become their new home‚Äîarduously cross the seas, determined to refashion themselves as a new people, a nation of victors rather than victims. It is about how, when they finally get there, they find their new homeland inhabited by locals who have no intention of making way for them. It is about how this geopolitical tragedy generates new wars, wars that will, in turn, trigger further conflicts: bella horrida bella. It is about how such conflicts leave those involved in them morally unrecognizable, even to themselves. This is a story that both the Old and the New Worlds know too well; and Virgil was the first to tell it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I disagree with the last sentence of the quote I pulled. The story the author describes is <em>also</em> the story of the Israelites in the Old Testament, which predates Virgil, though I‚Äôm not sure if Virgil could have known the stories. I‚Äôm sure the author intended us to think of that connection, though, based on how he wrote the passage. Consider me a little puzzled by this, but grateful to have read the article.</p>\n",
