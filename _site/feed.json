I wish Nest, the company, had done better with it, but they seem to have lost interest in their initial product years ago. </p>\n",

Basically, for most of the magazines it offers, it provides you <em>images</em> of magazines, with their crazy layouts and scads of advertisements, rather than access to the magazine‚Äôs website content. It was like reading a PDF rather than a webpage. The small text size, traditional print magazine layout, and the need to pan around the page made the reading experience very poor. Since it <em>looked good</em>, I am not sure if Apple will spend much time improving it, even though it was impossible to use.</p>\n",
