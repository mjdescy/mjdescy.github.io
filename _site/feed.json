The syntax for joins is awful, the lack of case statements is unfortunate, and the query editor is primitive. I vastly prefer SQL Server, and MySQL is OK as well.</p>\n",

I think a normal high school paper was 4 albums (R.E.M., Beatles, U2, Pink Floyd) or about 3 hours. I should do that again with my 🎧.</p>\n",
