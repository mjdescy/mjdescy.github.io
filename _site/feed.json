Their recommendations are basically unchanged, which is no surprise, because the entire trackball market has been stagnant for years.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the lack of evolution in trackballs, I am a huge fan of them. I credit swapping my mouse for a trackball with reducing, to almost nothing, repetitive stress injuries from computing. I find trackballs to be more comfortable to use and more precise than both mice and trackpads. I actually have one for each my my machines (Mac and PC), and bring the smaller one with me when I travel for work.</p>\n\n<p>I can‚Äôt quibble with WireCutter‚Äôs top pick, but I disagree with their assessment of my main trackball, the <a href=\"https://www.kensington.com/en/ae/4493/k72327eu/slimblade-trackball\">Kensington SlimBlade</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Instead of using a hardware scroll ring as on the Kensington Expert Mouse and Orbit with Scroll Ring, with the Kensington SlimBlade Trackball you have to rotate the ball to scroll, which is tough to do without bouncing the cursor around the screen. The SlimBlade‚Äôs buttons feel hollow compared with the Expert Mouse‚Äôs, and its shiny plastic and metal surfaces attract fingerprints.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, its buttons could be a little clickier, but rotating the ball to scroll without moving the cursor is actually pretty easy. Unlike the Expert Mouse, the SlimBlade doesn‚Äôt have an unnecessarily steep angle to it, so you can use it comfortably without a wrist rest. And, honestly, saying its ‚Äúsurfaces attract fingerprints‚Äù is just plain stupid. My iPad Pro screen, which is the finest screen in my entire house, ‚Äúattracts fingerprints‚Äù too. I think product reviewers need to strike that quibble off their list.</p>\n",

I am a huge fan of the band‚Äôs 2005-2008 work, a trifecta of literate rock albums: <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/black-sheep-boy-10th-anniversary-edition/1036936862\">Black Sheep Boy</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stand-ins/543561172\">The Stand Ins</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stage-names-bonus-track-version/453256340\">The Stage Names</a></em>. Each of these albums is a staggering artistic achievement; each song on them is an evocative short story with enough weight, depth, and maturity to reward repeated listenings.</p>\n\n<p>I haven‚Äôt spent nearly as many hours listening to their work since then, which which includes <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-silver-gymnasium/977288852\">The Silver Gymnasium</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/away/1113050258\">Away</a></em>. This, more recent, period is characterized by a darker, more somber tone. It‚Äôs easy to imagine the band‚Äôs frontman, and only consistent member now, Will Sheff, slowing down, looking back on life, and looking far forward to his eventual death. That‚Äôs way heavier stuff than what I normally listen to, but not <em>too</em> heavy to be enjoyable.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I am trying to get back into <a href=\"https://pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a>, the reliable and, a few years ago, faddish, ‚Äúantisocial‚Äù bookmarking service.</p>\n\n<p>I had been using it as an archive of my old browser bookmarks, and as a ‚Äúread it later‚Äù service to push articles to from Twitter and my RSS reader. I used to use it pretty consistently, with the help of an iOS app and a Chrome plugin for my Mac. When I went on an RSS and Twitter diet late last year, though, I kicked my Pinboard app off my phone as well. More recently, I wiped my Mac clean and reinstalled a bare minimum of apps and services, which did not include Chrome or the whatever Pinboard plugin I had been using with Safari. Since then, Safari and Google have been my bookmarking service, in that I don‚Äôt actually save any bookmarks, but rely on typing URLs or searches directly into the browser address bar most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, in part because iOS supports it in the long-press menu on every URL, I have been saving links to Apple‚Äôs built-in Safari Reading List. Saving bookmarks is as low-friction as can be, but reading them is, paradoxically, very high friction for me. I never think to dig into the second panel within Safari‚Äôs bookmarks to look for something to read. Consequently, my Safari Reading List has become a graveyard for links that I (think I) want to read but probably never will. Maybe that‚Äôs what is is actually for, and maybe that‚Äôs what I actually need.</p>\n\n<p>For fun, though, I‚Äôm going to try to use Pinboard more instead.</p>\n\n",

They are undeniably more poppy than his dark, moody, and undulating score for MATILDA; however, it‚Äôs obvious that he has written each of these compositions with the same consideration and care that he did with MATILDA. Despite the more simplistic sounding and pop aural soundscape, the melodies are intricately layered showing an artistry and skill that is not apparent in one listening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hope Tim Minchin keeps writing musicals. His music and lyrics for his prior show, <em>Matilda</em>, are a masterpiece. (Listen to the London cast recording over the Broadway one if you can; it is a <em>far</em> better performance, though it is missing some of Matilda‚Äôs monologues.) ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite rank as a masterpiece in my book, but it is really, really good.</p>\n\n",
