			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://joe-steel.com/2018-08-20-First-Time-Tooter-Long-Time-Tweeter.html\">This blog post</a> is a great overview of Mastodon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In conversations I‚Äôve had over the past week, it‚Äôs become clear that there‚Äôs nothing very self-explanatory about Mastodon as a social network, and that in many ways Twitter users are both prepared and unprepared for the experience. There are a lot of things that are similar in concept, but there‚Äôs more to it when it comes to how it‚Äôs a ‚Äúservice‚Äù that can really throw people for a loop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I use Mastodon <em>a little</em>, but don‚Äôt really feel strongly one way or another towards the platform. I <em>want</em> to like it more. I was super enthusiastic about its predecessors, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_social\">StatusNet</a> (nee Laconica, now GNU Social), but those failed to gain significant momentum, and became overrun with spam.</p>\n\n<p>Despite whatever is new and exciting about Mastodon‚Äôs web UI, open web features, etc., it doesn‚Äôt feel that new or exciting to me. It feels like a better StatusNet. I suppose, though, that I care more about writing and posting content, and owning it, than about the ephemeral and chatty aspects of social networking.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I bought my iPad Air 2 almost a year after it was released, only a few months before the first iPad Pro was released. I was a little worried at the time that I would get only a couple years out of it before iOS updates rendered it obsolete. I have been pleasantly surprised that that day has not yet arrived‚Äîand, based on how the iOS 12 beta is running, that day will not arrive for at least another year.</p>\n\n<p>Last night, I finally installed the iOS 12 beta on it, and found the new OS to be smooth, stable, and fast. All my apps (even the ones I wrote!) are working just fine. As Apple promised, UI and animation-related things like scrolling are visibly faster and smoother, too.</p>\n\n<p>I plan to install iOS 12 beta on my iPhone 7 Plus in early September, after I complete my next release of <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a>. Based what I‚Äôm seeing, performance wise, on my even-older iPad Air 2, I‚Äôm looking forward to at least one more year of service from my iPhone 7 Plus, too. (It helps that my phone has a brand new battery and a new screen, thanks to AppleCare Plus.)</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Dark Sky released a ground-up <a href=\"https://blog.darksky.net/the-new-dark-sky-app/\">rewrite of their flagship iOS app</a> today.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The most noticeable change is the introduction of a new unified timeline. Rather than separating the forecast onto multiple pages, we now combine the current conditions, next hour rain forecast, next 24 hours, and next week forecasts into a single scrollable view that lets you quickly get to the part of the forecast you care about. This makes it much easier to scan what will happen in the minutes, hours, and days ahead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dark Sky version 1.0, which was singularly focused on precipitation warnings and maps for your immediate vicinity, was probably my favorite iteration of the app. It wasn‚Äôt a full-fledged weather app at the time, but its singular focus was useful for me whenever I wanted to step out of the house or office.</p>\n\n<p>I have been using Weather Line, which uses Dark Sky weather data, almost exclusively for the past couple years, because its information layout was denser and more useful. This update may bring me back to Dark Sky, however. I‚Äôm moving it back to my home screen and will give it a go.</p>\n",
