			"title": "Mac apps are harder than iOS apps",
			
			"content_html": "<p>I agree with Matt Ronge‚Äôs article ‚Äú<a href=\"https://medium.com/astro-hq/mac-apps-are-harder-than-ios-apps-614338e2e470\">Mac apps are harder than iOS apps</a>‚Äù.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I was surprised when a recent project brought me back to the Mac and I discovered how finicky Cocoa really is. I was particularly shocked because I always remembered Cocoa as a particularly nice set of APIs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my experience, a <em>big</em> problem that Mr. Ronge does not mention is that there is very little information available online to help a macOS developer work through anything but the most basic situations. Sure, you can find some tutorials on <a href=\"https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/macos\">raywenderlich.com</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDg-YmnNehm3KB0BpytkUJg\">YouTube</a>, but once you go beyond the basics, good information is hard to find.</p>\n\n<p>If you search for ‚ÄúHow do I do X? on iOS‚Äù you will likely find dozens or hundreds of hits, including numerous tutorials, open source libraries, and Stack Overflow questions. Conversely, you will be lucky to find one or two resources for the query ‚ÄúHow do I do X? on macOS‚Äù (or OS X).</p>\n\n<p>It is understandable, because iOS is such a huge platform, but it is also quite frustrating, at least to a solo developer like me. If Apple creates <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps\">a new framework</a> or shim layer to let us use iOS frameworks on macOS, I think it would make making Mac apps a lot easier for predominantly iOS-oriented developers like me..</p>\n",

			"title": "1Blocker X",
			
			"content_html": "<p>I picked up <a href=\"https://1blocker.com/\">1Blocker X</a> based on <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/1blocker-x-for-ios-review/\">this review from John Voorhies on MacStores</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first thing you will notice when you set up 1Blocker X on an iOS device is its 7 toggles in Safari‚Äôs Content Blocker section of the Settings app. It‚Äôs a bit of a head-scratcher at first until you realize that this is what allows 1Blocker X to expand beyond the confines of its predecessor.</p>\n\n  <p>You see, iOS limits the number of blocking rules that can be implemented by an app to 50,000. That‚Äôs a lot of rules, but sadly not enough given the amount of junk on the Internet these days. As a result, it‚Äôs a limit that 1Blocker began to run into not long after it launched in 2015.</p>\n\n  <p>Finding a way around that hard limit required a rewrite of 1Blocker from the ground up. The result is 1Blocker X, an app with around three times as many blocking rules, room to grow, and enhanced flexibility for applying those rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt think I really needed to replace the content blocker I had been using, but it hadn‚Äôt been updated in a really long time, so I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs blocking rules are up-to-date.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the work these things do is invisilble. It‚Äôs easy to see if ads are blocked, of course, but not so with trackers and malware, which I care more about. At home I <em>also</em> block ads at the DNS level using <a href=\"https://pi-hole.net/\">Pi-hole</a>, running on an old Raspberry Pi. I heartily recommend setting up a Pi-hole (it‚Äôs easy; there are tutorials to follow). I miss having it when I‚Äôm out of the house, which is why a content blocker is helpful, too.</p>\n\n<p>So far, 1Blocker X has been working just fine. I‚Äôve noticed no decrease in speed from Safari, despite the crazy amount of blocking rules I have enabled.</p>\n",
