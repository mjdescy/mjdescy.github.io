			"content_html": "<p>Wirecutter updated its <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-trackballs/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=RSS%20Feed\">trackballs review</a> today. Their recommendations are basically unchanged, which is no surprise, because the entire trackball market has been stagnant for years.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the lack of evolution in trackballs, I am a huge fan of them. I credit swapping my mouse for a trackball with reducing, to almost nothing, repetitive stress injuries from computing. I find trackballs to be more comfortable to use and more precise than both mice and trackpads. I actually have one for each my my machines (Mac and PC), and bring the smaller one with me when I travel for work.</p>\n\n<p>I can‚Äôt quibble with WireCutter‚Äôs top pick, but I disagree with their assessment of my main trackball, the <a href=\"https://www.kensington.com/en/ae/4493/k72327eu/slimblade-trackball\">Kensington SlimBlade</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Instead of using a hardware scroll ring as on the Kensington Expert Mouse and Orbit with Scroll Ring, with the Kensington SlimBlade Trackball you have to rotate the ball to scroll, which is tough to do without bouncing the cursor around the screen. The SlimBlade‚Äôs buttons feel hollow compared with the Expert Mouse‚Äôs, and its shiny plastic and metal surfaces attract fingerprints.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, its buttons could be a little clickier, but rotating the ball to scroll without moving the cursor is actually pretty easy. Unlike the Expert Mouse, the SlimBlade doesn‚Äôt have an unnecessarily steep angle to it, so you can use it comfortably without a wrist rest. And, honestly, saying its ‚Äúsurfaces attract fingerprints‚Äù is just plain stupid. My iPad Pro screen, which is the finest screen in my entire house, ‚Äúattracts fingerprints‚Äù too. I think product reviewers need to strike that quibble off their list.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Listening to Okkervil River‚Äôs new album, <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-the-rainbow-rain/1342462882\">In the Rainbow Rain</a></em>, today gave me an excuse to dive, once again, into their back catalog. I am a huge fan of the band‚Äôs 2005-2008 work, a trifecta of literate rock albums: <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/black-sheep-boy-10th-anniversary-edition/1036936862\">Black Sheep Boy</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stand-ins/543561172\">The Stand Ins</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stage-names-bonus-track-version/453256340\">The Stage Names</a></em>. Each of these albums is a staggering artistic achievement; each song on them is an evocative short story with enough weight, depth, and maturity to reward repeated listenings.</p>\n\n<p>I haven‚Äôt spent nearly as many hours listening to their work since then, which which includes <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-silver-gymnasium/977288852\">The Silver Gymnasium</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/away/1113050258\">Away</a></em>. This, more recent, period is characterized by a darker, more somber tone. It‚Äôs easy to imagine the band‚Äôs frontman, and only consistent member now, Will Sheff, slowing down, looking back on life, and looking far forward to his eventual death. That‚Äôs way heavier stuff than what I normally listen to, but not <em>too</em> heavy to be enjoyable.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I am trying to get back into <a href=\"https://pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a>, the reliable and, a few years ago, faddish, ‚Äúantisocial‚Äù bookmarking service.</p>\n\n<p>I had been using it as an archive of my old browser bookmarks, and as a ‚Äúread it later‚Äù service to push articles to from Twitter and my RSS reader. I used to use it pretty consistently, with the help of an iOS app and a Chrome plugin for my Mac. When I went on an RSS and Twitter diet late last year, though, I kicked my Pinboard app off my phone as well. More recently, I wiped my Mac clean and reinstalled a bare minimum of apps and services, which did not include Chrome or the whatever Pinboard plugin I had been using with Safari. Since then, Safari and Google have been my bookmarking service, in that I don‚Äôt actually save any bookmarks, but rely on typing URLs or searches directly into the browser address bar most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, in part because iOS supports it in the long-press menu on every URL, I have been saving links to Apple‚Äôs built-in Safari Reading List. Saving bookmarks is as low-friction as can be, but reading them is, paradoxically, very high friction for me. I never think to dig into the second panel within Safari‚Äôs bookmarks to look for something to read. Consequently, my Safari Reading List has become a graveyard for links that I (think I) want to read but probably never will. Maybe that‚Äôs what is is actually for, and maybe that‚Äôs what I actually need.</p>\n\n<p>For fun, though, I‚Äôm going to try to use Pinboard more instead.</p>\n\n",

I get 5-10 robocalls per week, mostly from the same exchange as my mobile number or my Google Voice number.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to rely on a central service for all blocking rules, including an optional whitelist for your contacts and an optional rule based on your phone number for ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù spam. It can identify and block a gigantic list of known spammers and robocallers, which is beyond what I need.</p>\n\n<p>Having looked at it, and its competition, it seems like there isn‚Äôt a good on-device-only call blocker for the super-privacy conscious who, like me, only want to whitelist contacts and blacklist all other numbers in a couple of area codes and exchanges. I really want to write one. It would have to be free, I think, based on the free competition out there‚Äîbut it may fit a particular niche that is out there.</p>\n",

Considering how many products Google launches and kills each year for practically no reason, it‚Äôs astounding that one of its monumental flops has been allowed to limp along for so many years. I think it must still be around because either it still generates signals for Google (how many though, compared to other things?), or because it was tied in, at a technical level, to more valuable and integral services like Gmail. All I know is that its continued presence in the Google portfolio serves as yet another reminder to me about how unfocused Google is as an organization.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/groundhog-day-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1215389487\">Groundhog Day</a></em> is my second favorite Broadway musical of last year (closely behind ‚ÄúDear Evan Hansen‚Äù, which has more plot-related problems but really terrific music), and the only one I saw. I revisit the cast album from time to time, because it is terrific, and multiple listens reveal hidden depth in the earthy lyrics.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-CD-Review-GROUNDHOG-DAY-THE-MUSICAL-Original-Broadway-Cast-Recording-is-Charmingly-Animated-20170516\">Broadway World‚Äôs review of the cast album</a> is remarkably spot on.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On first listen, Minchin‚Äôs melodies are captivating. They are undeniably more poppy than his dark, moody, and undulating score for MATILDA; however, it‚Äôs obvious that he has written each of these compositions with the same consideration and care that he did with MATILDA. Despite the more simplistic sounding and pop aural soundscape, the melodies are intricately layered showing an artistry and skill that is not apparent in one listening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hope Tim Minchin keeps writing musicals. His music and lyrics for his prior show, <em>Matilda</em>, are a masterpiece. (Listen to the London cast recording over the Broadway one if you can; it is a <em>far</em> better performance, though it is missing some of Matilda‚Äôs monologues.) ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite rank as a masterpiece in my book, but it is really, really good.</p>\n\n",

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://qz.com/1264704/at-first-life-without-a-smartphone-was-terrifying-then-it-was-beautiful/\">This article on Quartz about limiting smartphone use</a> is both sublime and ridiculous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I want to be present. Is that so much to ask for? Is that so odd to crave in this day and age?</p>\n\n  <p>Maybe you‚Äôre reading this thinking I‚Äôm taking it too far and being ridiculous. That it‚Äôs just a smartphone, people check them all the time and that‚Äôs just the way it is and I should get over it and get used to it. But being on it most of my free time feels wrong on every level. I don‚Äôt want to get used to it anymore. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to reduce the amount of time I spend looking at this damn screen instead of being with my own thoughts. It shouldn‚Äôt be this challenging. But it is. And that says tons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A few years ago I wanted to do the same thing this author does‚Äîdowngrade from smartphone to dumbphone‚Äîbut to save money rather than to improve my contact with the outside world. My plan was to replace the smartphone with an iPad Mini, which I would use only on WiFi. Back then I shuttled every article I read from my RSS app (Reeder) to my read-it-later app (Pocket) and cached them offline, so I would rarely be without an offline time waster, to fill in those dull times in waiting rooms or on trains. I didn‚Äôt go through with the plan, though. I got caught up in smartphone fever along with everyone else in my office. It was an exciting time in the development of that technology‚Äîmuch more exciting than today.</p>\n\n<p>I think it is interesting and admirable to try to limit your smartphone use, and it is fun to read about someone‚Äôs experience with it. I <em>also</em> think that this essay is the sort of thing my grandchildren will read in history class, perhaps on the whatever slab of glass and silicon they carry, and laugh at how silly we were to distrust the most transformative technology of our time.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30\">The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things‚Äîand to try old things again. In that spirit, we‚Äôre launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It‚Äôll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.</p>\n\n<p>The New Yorker puzzle is a <em>tiny</em> bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I‚Äôm not a strong player), but I‚Äôm happy there‚Äôs another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming my way.</p>\n\n<p>I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.</p>\n",
