			"content_html": "<p><em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/groundhog-day-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1215389487\">Groundhog Day</a></em> is my second favorite Broadway musical of last year (closely behind “Dear Evan Hansen”, which has more plot-related problems but really terrific music), and the only one I saw. I revisit the cast album from time to time, because it is terrific, and multiple listens reveal hidden depth in the earthy lyrics.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-CD-Review-GROUNDHOG-DAY-THE-MUSICAL-Original-Broadway-Cast-Recording-is-Charmingly-Animated-20170516\">Broadway World’s review of the cast album</a> is remarkably spot on.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On first listen, Minchin’s melodies are captivating. They are undeniably more poppy than his dark, moody, and undulating score for MATILDA; however, it’s obvious that he has written each of these compositions with the same consideration and care that he did with MATILDA. Despite the more simplistic sounding and pop aural soundscape, the melodies are intricately layered showing an artistry and skill that is not apparent in one listening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hope Tim Minchin keeps writing musicals. His music and lyrics for his prior show, <em>Matilda</em>, are a masterpiece. (Listen to the London cast recording over the Broadway one if you can; it is a <em>far</em> better performance, though it is missing some of Matilda’s monologues.) “Groundhog Day” doesn’t quite rank as a masterpiece in my book, but it is really, really good.</p>\n\n",

For that matter, why don’t they “shorten silences” on their end, too? That way, everyone could benefit from better audio quality and a shorter runtime. I suspect that some of big, radio-show-based podcasts do, but it’s obvious that most other podcasts don’t.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Earlier this year, I completed reading <em><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One\">Ready Player One</a></em> by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an <a href=\"https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322\">episode of the “Triangulation” podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir</a>, who enthusiastically recommended the book.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as “the reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games”. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.</p>\n",

Is that so much to ask for? Is that so odd to crave in this day and age?</p>\n\n  <p>Maybe you’re reading this thinking I’m taking it too far and being ridiculous. That it’s just a smartphone, people check them all the time and that’s just the way it is and I should get over it and get used to it. But being on it most of my free time feels wrong on every level. I don’t want to get used to it anymore. It shouldn’t be this hard to reduce the amount of time I spend looking at this damn screen instead of being with my own thoughts. It shouldn’t be this challenging. But it is. And that says tons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A few years ago I wanted to do the same thing this author does—downgrade from smartphone to dumbphone—but to save money rather than to improve my contact with the outside world. My plan was to replace the smartphone with an iPad Mini, which I would use only on WiFi. Back then I shuttled every article I read from my RSS app (Reeder) to my read-it-later app (Pocket) and cached them offline, so I would rarely be without an offline time waster, to fill in those dull times in waiting rooms or on trains. I didn’t go through with the plan, though. I got caught up in smartphone fever along with everyone else in my office. It was an exciting time in the development of that technology—much more exciting than today.</p>\n\n<p>I think it is interesting and admirable to try to limit your smartphone use, and it is fun to read about someone’s experience with it. I <em>also</em> think that this essay is the sort of thing my grandchildren will read in history class, perhaps on the whatever slab of glass and silicon they carry, and laugh at how silly we were to distrust the most transformative technology of our time.</p>\n",

I have no desire to either upgrade or change these phones. […]</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>For conference calls and phone conversations, I use Apple AirPods.

They sit in my luggage and will be there until Bose stops making the replacement ear pads. They are not great for music, but on a loud aircraft, they are just a way to mute everything.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I love knowing that he and I have a similar lineup of headphones, and we split our time between them similarly: a top end headphone (except my top end are the Oppo PM-3, which cost a <em>lot</em> less than his Focal Clear); Apple AirPods for phone calls (I use them for calls, podcasts, and TV but almost never for music); and super old, now-crummy Bose for use on airplanes only.</p>\n",

Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it’s worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have <em>never</em> gotten a food borne illness from those activities.

			"title": "Finland Has Second Thoughts About Giving Free Money to Jobless People",
			
			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://nyti.ms/2HpHmQE\">Finland is letting its yearlong experiment with Universal Basic Income expire</a>. It turns out giving out tax money to people with no strings attached isn’t widely popular. What is interesting to me, a US citizen, is this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant.</p>\n\n  <p>Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth.</p>\n\n  <p>“In a sense,” said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, “Finland already has basic income.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I support Universal Basic Income. I think it would help the poor and would spur more people, like me, to start their own businesses. Of course, if we in the US had government provided healthcare, education, and job training programs, it might be enough to spur new business creation. I have the talent to start a consultancy, but the responsibility to pay for healthcare and my children’s education has always made me feel more secure with a normal, salaried position.</p>\n",

Existing members who renew their Prime memberships will have to pay the new rate beginning June 16.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perversely, this news is making me want to buy <em>more</em> from them, to get a better value on shipping. I bet Amazon is expecting that response from some of their most loyal customers.</p>\n",
