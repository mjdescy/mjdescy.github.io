It‚Äôs unusual for a band to re-record songs <em>in the studio</em> (live albums are another thing entirely). I found it enjoyable to listen to, though I‚Äôm not sure why they did it. The production is more modern‚Äîread, a lot louder, but with a larger soundstage‚Äîbut the songs aren‚Äôt re-interpreted or anything.</p>\n\n<p>Texas did this, too, with <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_25\">Texas 25</a>, which marked their 25th anniversary as a band. Texas reinterpreted some of their songs, though. That album sounds great and is worth a listen.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://micro.mjdescy.me/uploads/2018/a3006dc27d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",
