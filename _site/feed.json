I‚Äôm not sure just how much I liked it, as reading it was a little like watching somebody else play video games, which is not really my thing, but I did like it. I‚Äôm glad the author addressed the isolation of all the main characters in real life, at least a little. It could have had more depth in that area, but that might have diminished its charm.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mjdescy.micro.blog/uploads/2018/94ab55d10a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",
