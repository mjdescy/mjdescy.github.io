			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/business/dealbook/general-electric-dow-jones.html\">It‚Äôs the end of an era.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, don‚Äôt even get me started as to the idiocy of following a price-weighted stock index in the age of computers, but being part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average\">DJIA</a> is a huge badge of honor that G.E. has now lost.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company‚Äôs new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company‚Äôs financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The recent decline of G.E. has been shocking to me. When I was at business school in Connecticut, G.E. was, rightly, considered a giant of industry and of financial services. Now it appears to be a lumbering giant, a lion in winter. I wonder what it will take to turn the company around.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>This <a href=\"http://subfurther.com/blog/2018/06/17/apple-didnt-kill-appkit-millenials-did/\">article</a>, quite rightly, made me feel bad about not pushing through the troubles I had porting SwiftoDo to the Mac‚Äîa project I haven‚Äôt touched in over a year now.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it really that hard to share a codebase between Mac and iOS? I just sent off the ‚Äúother platforms‚Äù chapter of Xcode Treasures, and one of the sections is about creating multi-platform projects. The book shows how to add tvOS to an iOS project from earlier in the book, but the idea is the same regardless of which platforms you support: portion off the code you can into cross-platform frameworks, ideally leaving only platform-specific UI code in each platform‚Äôs targets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I modularized a lot of my code to allow it to happen someday, but found out that it would require a lot of work to ramp up my AppKit skills. All the data manipulation code is in a well-contained library. That‚Äôs just a small part of the app, though. The features are all in UI code, and porting it to AppKit resembles a 90% rewrite of my app.</p>\n\n<p>If I was doing development professionally, I would have done it. But as a hobbyist, it‚Äôs hard to want to dive deep into AppKit when there are a million things to create or fix on iOS, which feels like Apple‚Äôs future platform anyway. Maybe I‚Äôm lazy, and maybe Apple is going to help me out with UIKit on the Mac twelve months from now.</p>\n",

I had avoided it for years, due to its complexity and because it was <em>too much</em> for my projects. I decided to learn it to challenge myself and to level up a bit as an iOS developer.</p>\n\n<p>Learning it reminds me of learning Objective C and Cocoa years ago. Core Data presents itself as a daunting hierarchy of NS-prefixed classes, with lots of layers and moving parts, but it (kind of) makes sense after a long period of study. It‚Äôs starting to make sense to me now, though I have barely scratched the surface of its functionality.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôve been writing and rewriting and never finishing the same sample app for the past week. Of course, I made it difficult for myself by requiring it to have an App Group, and for the Core Data stack to be defined in its own Framework. I figured out how to do so a couple days ago, and then, this morning, stumbled on the exact same process recommended in <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/224\">Apple‚Äôs WWDC 2018 Core Data Best Practices video </a>. At least I know I got part of my Core Data stack set up the right way!</p>\n",
