			"content_html": "<p>I am enjoying “The Last Jedi” a lot more on the second viewing. I didn’t like it when I first saw it in the theatre, for a dozen different reasons. But now I get it in a way I hadn’t. Some things I thought were annoying, like Po’s actions, were <em>supposed</em> to be. The whole movie is about learning from failure, and is well structured around that theme.</p>\n",

I’ve lived too long without it to feel like it is necessary now. The Nest has not noticeably improved since I got it. The best thing I did with it is set it up with Homebridge to use with Siri. It works faster and more reliably through that hack than through the official iOS and watchOS apps. I wish Nest, the company, had done better with it, but they seem to have lost interest in their initial product years ago. </p>\n",

I had very low expectations, due to its grim, overly macho <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-DM9uBtVI\">preview</a> and <a href=\"http://batmanvsuperman.dccomics.com\">predecessor</a>. I’m a comic book fan, though, and “Justice League” felt like the sort of story i’ve seen many times before, but, of course, filmed in live action with tons of special effects. I thought that the film <em>did</em> have problems, but it was obviously made for comic book fans—who have read and seen the save-the-world story many times before, and want to see an even bigger version of it—and it succeeded more than all the negative reviews suggested. Yes, I could quibble about a dozen things, and I think the movie would have been even better with just Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman in it, but I enjoyed it quite a bit, and hope they make a sequel in a couple years.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://512pixels.net/2018/03/apple-buys-texture-the-digital-magazine-service/\">Apple buying Texture</a> is interesting and unexpected to me. I subscribed to Texture for a couple weeks and did not like it because I found it too hard to read on my iPad and iPhone. Basically, for most of the magazines it offers, it provides you <em>images</em> of magazines, with their crazy layouts and scads of advertisements, rather than access to the magazine’s website content. It was like reading a PDF rather than a webpage. The small text size, traditional print magazine layout, and the need to pan around the page made the reading experience very poor. Since it <em>looked good</em>, I am not sure if Apple will spend much time improving it, even though it was impossible to use.</p>\n",
