While this <em>is</em> a weak year for the American musical, the music of ‚ÄúMean Girls‚Äù is fun and catchy, and the lyrics are funny and full of wordplay. The singing and production of the cast album are top notch, too.</p>\n\n<p>I like it. The high school setting and girl-centric plot, though not the music, remind me a lot of ‚ÄúBring It On‚Äù, which is another musical that has a fantastic cast album and works a lot better than you would think. I don‚Äôt know if this show will be a hit on Broadway, but I predict a long life on high school drama club stages in the future.</p>\n",

I have no idea what Google audio/video service I should ever consider subscribing to, and because music is tied in there, they don‚Äôt offer what I want (ad-free YouTube) at price that is reasonable to me. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter, because Google will just fold it and create an alternative service, with a different name, price, and product mix, in a couple years anyway.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I rely on Google Search, and as much as I use, indifferently, Gmail, I just don‚Äôt understand Google as a company. Their central strategy appears to be ‚Äúno strategy‚Äù. They try stuff out, kill it if it fails, and iterate on what succeeds. This process is fun to watch when the company is a young startup, but is a bit much to bear when they are one of the four pillars of the internet.</p>\n\n<p>If my kids didn‚Äôt love YouTube, but hate the ads, I wouldn‚Äôt think about subscribing to YouTube Premium (or is it YouTube Red? or is it YouTube Music?) at all. If Google cared about customers like me‚Äîvery light YouTube viewers who would pay a small amount of money to not be interrupted by ads‚ÄîI would send them some money each month.</p>\n",
