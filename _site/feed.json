It‚Äôs an incredibly well-written and well-researched book. I had stopped reading it because I thought its subject matter‚Äîthe break-up of the United States due to intractable racial prejudice‚Äîhit a little too close to home for 2017-18. Regardless, I am now continuing.</p>\n",

It‚Äôs kind of a bummer, though, because VBA is terrible.   Native Python support in Office can‚Äôt come soon enough for me.</p>\n",
