			"content_html": "<p>I‚Äôm working on retiring Dropbox from all my systems. For personal files, I am all in on iCloud. For work files, which I want separate, I am going to use OneDrive (which is IT-supported). I am stuck, though, trying to figure out what text (and Markdown) editor I can use on iOS that will be acceptable to me. Pretext crashes on long files, but is otherwise OK. 1Writer is OK, but had trouble opening some of my files, and I don‚Äôt like its floating buttons. There are so many decent Dropbox-enabled text editors on iOS, but very few that integrate well with the Files app.</p>\n",
